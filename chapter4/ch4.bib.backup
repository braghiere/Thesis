abstract = {Gap fraction in homogeneous crop canopies is usually computed using the Poisson law. For heterogeneous canopies, gap fraction may be computed by assuming the canopy to be made of contiguous cells, in which the Poisson law is used. However, the implicit hypothesis of random phyto-element position is frequently violated, because of plant structure and canopy planting pattern. This may empirically be taken into account by introducing an additional dispersion parameter. However, we are unable, from a deterministic approach, to predict such a parameter. Most experimental works to study the relations between gap fraction and canopy structure suffer from the limited accuracy of the measurements. A laboratory experiment was therefore conducted on artificial canopies, which enabled an accurate description of both structure and gap fraction. The usual turbid medium approach, with random leaf dispersion, but an accurate description of spatial variations of canopy structure, enabled us to predict the directional gap fraction of the artificial canopies with a maximum error of about 0.06. The accuracy of simulations remained fairly good when using simplified descriptions of structure, provided that they took into account most of the spatial variations of leaf area index. The residual error of 0.06 indicates however a significant departure from the Poisson law. Analysis of spatial and directional dependence of gap fraction measurements showed that fitting simulated and experimental data required the introduction of a dispersion parameter incorporating spatial, zenith, and azimuth variations.},

abstract = {A spatially explicit 3-D model of crown geometry is combined with a radiative transfer model for heterogeneous media to predict the transmittance of a discontinuous Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) canopy under different architectural assumptions. The canopy gap fraction was sampled with a Plant Canopy Analyser (PCA; LAI 2000, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at 200 regularly spaced points in the understorey. A comparison of predicted and observed values of diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) shows that the above model can predict most of the spatial variability of the diffuse fluxes (R2 = 0.97). In order to evaluate the variation in light penetration due to needle clumping in shoots, two architectural hypotheses are tested: random distribution of needles (scenario 1) and of shoots (scenario 2) within crowns. Results indicate that the variability in the radiative fluxes due to shoot architecture is rather limited in comparison with the variability generated by canopy discontinuities. However, assuming shoots as the basic foliage element slightly improves the model performance. The predictive accuracy for the two architectural hypotheses is similar, with a mean absolute percent error of 12.2 and 12.0{\%} for scenarios 1 and 2; respectively. The predictive bias is almost equivalent in magnitude but opposite in sign (mean percent error of -4.82 and 3.55{\%} for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively). The underestimation of the DIFN in the first scenario suggests that, when needles are considered as basic foliage elements, the spatial distribution is not random, but clumped. On the contrary, the overestimation of DIFN in scenario 2 indicates that the spatial distribution of shoots is more regular than random. The angular distribution of the predictive error in the bands of the PCA suggests that the angular distribution of the shoot normal was more ellipsoidal than the spherical one adopted in the simulation, while leaf clumping in whorls appears to be the source of the high gap fraction at larger zenith angles.},

abstract = {The feasibility of detecting the seasonal variation in leaf area index (LAI) in boreal conifer forests is investigated using optical instruments. The LAI of six stands was measured. They include young and old jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and old black spruce (Picea mariana) located near the southern border (near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan) and near the northern border (near Thompson, Manitoba) of the Canadian boreal ecotone. LAI values of the stands are obtained by making several corrections to the effective LAI measured from the LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA). The corrections include a foliage element (shoot) clumping index (for clumping at scales larger than the shoot) measured using the optical instrument TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies) developed by Chen and Cihlar (Chen, J.M. and Cihlar, J., 1995a, Plant canopy gap size analysis theory for improving optical measurements of leaf area index of plant canopies, Appl. Opt., 34: 6211–6222), a needle-to-shoot area ratio (for clumping within the shoot) obtained from shoot samples, and a woody-to-total area ratio obtained through destructive sampling of trees. It is found that the effective LAI varied about 5{\%} to 10{\%} in the growing season and the element clumping index remained almost unchanged. The needle-to-shoot area ratio varied the most, about 15{\%} to 25{\%}, which is of the same order of magnitude as the expected seasonal variability in LAI. This demonstrates that most of the seasonal variation information is contained in the needle-to-shoot area ratio, which can not be measured indirectly using in situ optical instruments and has to be obtained from a large quantity of shoot sample analysis which is laborious and error-prone. Based on our experience, an improved and convenient shoot sampling strategy is suggested for future studies. The optically-based LAI values were compared with destructive sampling results for three of the stands. Based on error analysis, we believe that optical measurements combined with shoot sample analysis can produce LAI values for conifer stands which are more accurate than destructive sampling results.},

research is needed to improve our ability to model the bidirectional

reflectance model presented in this paper considers four scales of
canopy architecture: tree groups, tree crowns, branches and shoots. It
differs from the Li-Strahler's model in the following respects: 1) the
assumption of random spatial distribution of trees is replated by the
Neyman distribution which is able to model the patchiness or clumpiness
of a forest stand; 2) the multiple mutual shadowing effect between tree
crowns is considered using a negative binomial and the Neyman
distribution theory; 3) the effect of the sunlit background is modeled
using a canopy gap size distribution function that affects the magnitude
and width of the hotspot; 4) the branch architecture affecting the
directional reflectance is simulated using a simple angular radiation
penetration function; and 5) the tree crown surface is treated as a
complex surface with microscale structures which themselves generate
mutual shadows and a hotspot. All these scales of canopy architecture
are shown to have effects on the directional distribution of the
reflected radiance from conifer forests. The model results compare well
with a data set from a boreal spruce forest},

abstract = {Sunlit and shaded leaf separation proposed by Norman (1982) is an effective way to upscale from leaf to canopy in modeling vegetation photosynthesis. The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) makes use of this methodology, and has been shown to be reliable in modeling the gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from CO2flux and tree ring measurements. In this study, we use BEPS to investigate the effect of canopy architecture on the global distribution of GPP. For this purpose, we use not only leaf area index (LAI) but also the first ever global map of the foliage clumping index derived from the multiangle satellite sensor POLDER at 6 km resolution. The clumping index, which characterizes the degree of the deviation of 3-dimensional leaf spatial distributions from the random case, is used to separate sunlit and shaded LAI values for a given LAI. Our model results show that global GPP in 2003 was 132 ± 22 Pg C. Relative to this baseline case, our results also show: (1) global GPP is overestimated by 12{\%} when accurate LAI is available but clumping is ignored, and (2) global GPP is underestimated by 9{\%} when the effective LAI is available and clumping is ignored. The clumping effects in both cases are statistically significant (p < 0.001). The effective LAI is often derived from remote sensing by inverting the measured canopy gap fraction to LAI without considering the clumping. Global GPP would therefore be generally underestimated when remotely sensed LAI (actually effective LAI by our definition) is used. This is due to the underestimation of the shaded LAI and therefore the contribution of shaded leaves to GPP. We found that shaded leaves contribute 50{\%}, 38{\%}, 37{\%}, 39{\%}, 26{\%}, 29{\%} and 21{\%} to the total GPP for broadleaf evergreen forest, broadleaf deciduous forest, evergreen conifer forest, deciduous conifer forest, shrub, C4 vegetation, and other vegetation, respectively. The global average of this ratio is 35{\%}.},

To determine foliage clumping within conifer shoots, a video camera and rotational light table system was used. The major difficulties in determining the surface area of small conifer needles have been largely overcome by the use of an accurate volume displacement method.

abstract = {Simple but realistic modeling of radiation transfer within heterogeneous canopy has been a challenging research question for decades and is critical for predicting ecological processes such as photosynthesis. The Markov model proposed by [Nilson, T., 1971. A theoretical analysis of the frequency of gaps in plant stands. Agric. Meteorol. 8, 25-38] is theoretically sound to meet this challenge. However, it has not been widely used because of the difficulty of determining the clumping factor. We propose an analytical approach to calculate clumping factors based on the average characteristics of vegetation distributed across a landscape. In a savanna woodland in California, we simulate the photosynthesis of the landscape in three different ways: (1) the crown envelope and location of each tree is spatially explicitly specified, (2) the canopy is assumed to be horizontally homogeneous within which leaves are randomly dispersed as a Poisson process, and (3) the canopy is horizontally homogeneous but leaves are clumped and distributed with a Markov process. We find that the Markov model can achieve much better performance than the Poisson model by incorporating the crown-level clumping. The results indicate that our approach of calculating clumping factors has applications in terrestrial ecosystem modeling, particularly where accurate representation of "system heterogeneity" (e.g., savannas and woodlands) is required. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes the consolidation of these advances in the modelling of carbon fluxes and stores, in both the vegetation and soil, in version 2.2 of JULES. Features include a multi-layer canopy scheme for light interception, including a sunfleck penetration scheme, a coupled scheme of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, representation of the effects of ozone on leaf physiology, and a description of methane emissions from wetlands. JULES represents the carbon allocation, growth and population dynamics of five plant functional types. The turnover of carbon from living plant tissues is fed into a 4-pool soil carbon model. The process-based descriptions of key ecological processes and trace gas fluxes in JULES mean that this community model is well-suited for use in carbon cycle, climate change and impacts studies, either in standalone mode or as the land component of a coupled Earth system model.},

abstract = {Process-based models (PBMs) of vegetation function can be used to interpret and integrate experimental results. Water limitation to plant carbon uptake is a highly uncertain process in the context of environmental change, and many experiments have been carried out that study drought limitations to vegetation function at spatial scales from seedlings to entire canopies. What is lacking in the synthesis of these experiments is a quantitative tool incorporating a detailed mechanistic representation of the water balance that can be used to integrate and analyse experimental results at scales of both the whole-plant and the forest canopy. To fill this gap, we developed an individual tree-based model (MAESPA), largely based on combining the well-known MAESTRA and SPA ecosystem models. The model includes a hydraulically-based model of stomatal conductance, root water uptake routines, drainage, infiltration, runoff and canopy interception, as well as detailed radiation interception and leaf physiology routines from the MAESTRA model. The model can be applied both to single plants of arbitrary size and shape, as well as stands of trees. The utility of this model is demonstrated by studying the interaction between elevated [CO2] (eCa) and drought. Based on theory, this interaction is generally expected to be positive, so that plants growing in eCa should be less susceptible to drought. Experimental results, however, are varied. We apply the model to a previously published experiment on droughted cherry, and show that changes in plant parameters due to long-term growth at eCa (acclimation) may strongly affect the outcome of Ca × drought experiments. We discuss potential applications of MAESPA and some of the key uncertainties in process representation.},

abstract = {Most land surface and ecosystem models assume that a vegetated canopy can be abstracted as a turbid medium when such models compute mass, energy, and carbon exchange. However, those models fail to simulate radiation environments in heterogeneous landscapes. This study aims to couple a spatially explicit three-dimensional (3D) shortwave and longwave radiative transfer model with a soil and canopy energy balance and canopy physiology model (CANOAK-FLiES), to investigate how well the 3D model performs in a heterogeneous landscape compared to a 1D model. The canopy structural parameters were extracted using airborne-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and digital cover photographs. The developed model was compared with a wide variety of field and remote sensing data (e.g., hyper-spectral remote sensing images, overstory and understory radiation, and tower-based energy and CO2 fluxes) in a woody oak savanna in CA, USA. Overall, the simulated spatial and diurnal patterns of the radiation environment were consistent with the measurements of shortwave and longwave wavebands. The 3D approach worked better than the 1D approach from the wet mild spring to the dry hot summer while the relative importance of using the 3D approach depends on climate and canopy physiological conditions as well as the canopy structure. With low leaf area index in the oak woodland, the woody elements absorbed 12{\%}-39{\%} of the PAR and 20{\%}-52{\%} of the NIR radiation. Consequently, 12{\%} of the daytime energy flux was used as woody heat storage at our study site. This novel 3D model has the potential to serve as a useful tool for analyzing the spatio-temporal variability of radiation and energy fluxes in evaluating footprints of radiation sensors and eddy covariance fluxes, and serve as a standard in evaluating the performance of a hierarchy of simpler land surface models to compute mass and energy exchange of heterogeneous landscapes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Multiband Vegetation Imager (MVI) measurements and Monte Carlo simulations showed that values of the zenith element clumping index (Omega(e)(0)) are typically between 0.4 and 0.5 in jack pine and black spruce and 0.65 in aspen. Estimates of LAI obtained from MVI measurements of the canopy gap fraction and adjusted for canopy clumping and branch architecture yielded LAI values of 3.0 in jack pine, 3.3 in aspen, and about 6.0 in black spruce. These LAI estimates were within 10-25{\%} of direct measurements made at the same sites. Data obtained with the MVI, along with numerical simulations, demonstrated that assumptions of random foliage distributions in boreal forests are invalid and could yield erroneous values of LAI measured by indirect techniques and false characterizations of atmosphere-biosphere interactions. Monte Carlo simulations were used to develop a general equation for beam radiation penetration as a function of zenith angle in clumped canopies, The essential measurements included stem spacing, crown diameter, crown depth, and within-crown gap fraction.},

abstract = {Leaf area and its spatial distribution are key canopy parameters needed to model the radiation regime within a forest and to compute the mass and energy exchange between a forest and the atmosphere. A much larger proportion of available net radiation is received at the forest floor in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. The proportion of ecosystem water vapor exchange (lambda E) and sensible heat exchange from the forest floor is therefore expected to be larger in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. We used a combination of optical and canopy geometry measurements, and robust one- and three-dimensional models to evaluate the influence of canopy architecture and radiative transfer on estimates of carbon, water and energy exchange of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forest. Three-dimensional model simulations showed that the average probability of diffuse and direct radiation transmittance to the forest floor was greater than if a random distribution of foliage had been assumed. Direct and diffuse radiation transmittance to the forest floor was 28 and 39{\%}, respectively, in the three-dimensional model simulations versus 23 and 31{\%}, respectively, in the one-dimensional model simulations. The assumption of randomly distributed foliage versus inclusion of clumping factors in a one-dimensional, multi-layer biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange model (CANVEG) had the greatest effect on simulated annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil evaporation. Assuming random distribution, NEE was 41{\%} lower, net photosynthesis 3{\%} lower, total lambda E 10{\%} lower, and soil evaporation 40{\%} lower. The same comparisons at LAI 5 showed a similar effect on annual NEE estimates (37{\%}) and lambda E (12{\%}), but a much larger effect on net photosynthesis (20{\%}), suggesting that, at low LAI, canopies are mostly sunlit, so that redistribution of light has little effect on net photosynthesis, whereas the effect on net photosynthesis is much greater at high LAIs.},

abstract = {A new model for the bidirectional reflectance of a vegetation
cover combines principles of geometric optics and radiative transfer. It
relies on gap probabilities and path length distributions to model the
penetration of irradiance from a parallel source and the single and
multiple scattering of that irradiance in the direction of an observer.
The model applies to vegetation covers of discrete plant crowns that are
randomly centered both on the plane and within a layer of variable
thickness above it. Crowns assume a spheroidal shape with arbitrary
height to width ratio. Geometric optics easily models the irradiance
that penetrates the vegetation cover directly, is scattered by the soil,
and exits without further scattering by the vegetation. Within a plant
crown, the probability of scattering is a negative exponential function
of path length. Within-crown scattering provides the source for
singly-scattered radiation, which exits with probabilities proportional
to further path-length distributions in the direction of exitance
(including the hotspot effect). Single scattering provides the source
for double scattering, and then higher order pairs of scattering are
solved successively by a convolution function. Early validations using
data from a conifer stand near Howland, Maine, show reasonable agreement
between modeled and observed reflectance},

abstract = {Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are an essential part of current state-of-the-art Earth system models. In recent years, the complexity of DGVMs has increased by incorporating new important processes like, e.g., nutrient cycling and land cover dynamics, while biogeophysical processes like surface radiation have not been developed much further. Canopy radiation models are however very important for the estimation of absorption and reflected fluxes and are essential for a proper estimation of surface carbon, energy and water fluxes. The present study provides an overview of current implementations of canopy radiation schemes in a couple of state-of-the-art DGVMs and assesses their accuracy in simulating canopy absorption and reflection for a variety of different surface conditions. Systematic deviations in surface albedo and fractions of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (faPAR) are identified and potential impacts are assessed. The results show clear deviations for both, absorbed and reflected, surface solar radiation fluxes. FaPAR is typically underestimated, which results in an underestimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) for the investigated cases. The deviation can be as large as 25{\%} in extreme cases. Deviations in surface albedo range between ĝ̂'0.15 ĝ‰Currency sign $\Delta$$\alpha$ĝ‰Currency sign 0.36, with a slight positive bias on the order of $\Delta$$\alpha$ĝ‰̂ 0.04. Potential radiative forcing caused by albedo deviations is estimated at ĝ̂'1.25 ĝ‰Currency sign RF ĝ‰Currency sign ĝ̂'0.8 (W mĝ̂'2), caused by neglect of the diurnal cycle of surface albedo. The present study is the first one that provides an assessment of canopy RT schemes in different currently used DGVMs together with an assessment of the potential impact of the identified deviations. The paper illustrates that there is a general need to improve the canopy radiation schemes in DGVMs and provides different perspectives for their improvement. © Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {A detailed sensitivity analysis investigating the effect of woody elements introduced into the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model on the nadir bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) for a simulated Norway spruce canopy was performed at a very high spatial resolution (modelling resolution 0.2 m, output pixel size 0.4 m). We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i.e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents). The simulation of each scenario was performed for 10 different canopy closures (CC = 50-95{\%}, in steps of 5{\%}), 25 leaf area index (LAI = 3.0-15.0 m2 m- 2, in steps of 0.5 m2 m- 2), and in four spectral bands (centred at 559, 671, 727, and 783 nm, with a FWHM of 10 nm). The influence of woody elements was evaluated separately for both, sunlit and shaded parts of the simulated forest canopy, respectively. The DART results were verified by quantifying the simulated nadir BRF of each scenario with measured Airborne Imaging Spectroradiometer (AISA) Eagle data (pixel size of 0.4 m). These imaging spectrometer data were acquired over the same Norway spruce stand that was used to parameterise the DART model. The Norway spruce canopy modelled using the DART model consisted of foliage as well as foliage including robust woody constituents (i.e. trunks and branches). All results showed similar nadir BRF for the simulated wavelengths. The incorporation of small woody parts in DART caused the canopy reflectance to decrease about 4{\%} in the near-infrared (NIR), 2{\%} in the red edge (RE) and less than 1{\%} in the green band. The canopy BRF of the red band increased by about 2{\%}. Subsequently, the sensitivity on accounting for woody elements for two spectral vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the angular vegetation index (AVI), was evaluated. Finally, we conclude on the importance of including woody elements in radiative transfer based approaches and discuss the applicability of the vegetation indices as well as the physically based inversion approaches to retrieve the forest canopy LAI at very high spatial resolution. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We tested the ability of a model to scale gas exchange from leaf level to whole-tree level by: (1) measuring leaf gas exchange in the canopy of 10 trees in a tall Eucalyptus delegatensis RT Baker forest in NSW, Australia; (2) monitoring sap flow of the same 10 trees during the measurement week; and (3) using an individual-tree-based model (MAESTRA) to link the two sets of measurements. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance components of the model were parameterized with the leaf gas exchange data, and canopy structure was parameterized with crown heights, dimensions and leaf areas of each of the measurement trees and up to 45 neighboring trees. Transpiration of the measurement trees was predicted by the model and compared with sap flow data. Leaf gas exchange parameters were similar for all 10 trees, with the exception of two smaller trees that had relatively low stomatal conductances. We hypothesize that these trees may have experienced water stress as a result of competition from large neighboring trees. The model performed well, and in most cases, was able to replicate the time course of tree transpiration. Maximum rates of transpiration were higher than measured rates for some trees and lower than measured rates for others, which may have been a result of inaccuracy in estimating tree leaf area. There was a small lag (about 15-30 minutes) between sap flow and modeled transpiration for some trees in the morning, likely associated with use of water stored in stems. The model also captured patterns of variation in sap flow among trees. Overall, the study confirms the ability of models to estimate forest canopy transpiration from leaf-level measurements.},

Additional model improvement was not significant when incorporating more realistic vertical variation of photosynthetic capacity. Even with the improved representation of radiation interception, JULES simulations of net carbon uptake underestimate eddy covariance measurements by 14{\%}. This discrepancy can be removed by either increasing the photosynthetic capacity throughout the canopy or by explicitly including light inhibition of leaf respiration. Along with published evidence of such inhibition of leaf respiration, our study suggests this effect should be considered for inclusion in other GCMs.},

abstract = {Ecological-sociological investigations of plant communities must be based on the matter production of plants. The matter production is discussed in this study on the basis of light intensity and leaf quantity in a plant community. 1. The productive structure of a plant community is demonstrated by the stratified-clipping method. Here, we separate plant materials into photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. With diagrams of production structure, we can distinguish two main types of plant communities, the broad-leaf type and the grass-type. 2. The light intensity in forest communities is generally 2–20 {\%} of the ambient light. The darkest community in our observations was a bamboo thicket of Phyllostachys, with a relative brightness in summer of 02–05 {\%}. Under these conditions, some plants of the ground flora become naturally etiolated. 3. Within well-growing herbosa, it is relatively dark compared with forest shade, i.e. the relative brightness is generally only 2–3 {\%}. The leaf area of herbosa is not less than that of lignosa. Generally, the leaf area index (inm2 perm2 ground area) of the observed herbosa is 4 to 7 or more. 4. The light intensity decreases by and large exponentially through the leaf layers. It thus follows the equation I = I0eKF where I is the light intensity in the plant community, I0 is the incoming light, K is the extinction coefficient, and F is the leaf area index. K is nearly constant for the same plant communities, but varies widely between different communities: our observations yielded values between 03 and 2. But, generally, K for the grass-type is approx. 03–05, and for the broad-leaf type approx. 07–1. 5. The light extinction in a leaf community is theoretically discussed with regard to leaf position and leaf angle. We show clearly that the extinction coefficient for ideally distributed horizontal leaves is 1, while for inclined leaves it can decrease with the leaf angle down to 044 (for a leaf angle of 90). A mosaic-like leaf distribution increases K. 6. The development of the production structure of a plant community, especially of the photosynthetic system, is strongly constrained by matter production. For example, the lower layer can only develop according to the remaining productivity, which corresponds to the brightness under the leaf area of the upper layer. This phenomenon is clearly demonstrated by observations of the seasonal development of Phragmites–Sanguisorba associations and of vine communities. The lower community disappears with the growth of the upper community. 7. A theoretical equation is formulated for the calculation of matter production for a leaf community. With this equation, we can calculate total production on the basis of the light-assimilation curve for a single leaf, the leaf area index and the extinction coefficient. There is an optimal leaf area for the maximum productivity under a given incoming light intensity. A smaller extinction coefficient is advantageous for matter production under stronger light, while a larger one is more advantageous under weaker light. 8. We tested the theoretical productivity equation with Boysen Jensen’s experimental data for Sinapis and Avena cultures. The calculated productivity agrees quite well with the observed one.},

Whorl orientation distributions are derived from multidirectional measurements using a geometric optical mutual shadowing model. For BOREAS test stands, model estimates and vertical measurements of photosynthetically active radiation transmittance within the canopy show (1) general decreases in transmission as solar zenith angles increase in the range of solar zenith angles dominated by beam irradiance, (2) increases in PAR transmission at very high solar zenith angles where diffuse skylight is dominant, (3) maximum scattering and absorption occur in the middle of the canopy. Model estimates match measurements from the forest floor, indicating the value of the model for providing radiation inputs to snowmelt models in forested landscapes.},

abstract = {This study develops a simple but physically based canopy radiative transfer scheme for photosynthesis, radiative fluxes and surface albedo estimates in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and particularly for the Ent Dynamic Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (Ent DGTEM). The Ent DGTEM can represent vegetation in mixed as opposed to homogeneous canopies. With active growth and competition, it must predict radiative transfer for dynamically changing vegetation structure, and requires computational speed for coupling with atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). The canopy radiative transfer scheme accounts for both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of plant canopies by combining the simple two-stream scheme with a well-described actual vertical foliage profile, an analytically derived foliage clumping factor from geometric optical theory, and, for needleleaf trees, an empirical needle-to-shoot-clumping factor. In addition, the model accounts for the effect of trunks, which is significant in bare canopies. This model provides better radiation estimates (light profiles, albedo) than the two-stream scheme currently being used in most GCMs to describe light interactions with vegetation canopies. This scheme has the same computational cost as the current typical scheme being used in GCMs, but promises to provide better canopy radiative transfer estimates for DGVMs, particularly those that model heterogeneous vegetation canopies. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Theories describing radiative transfer in plant canopies are very well developed for canopies approximating full cover. However, for canopies of partial cover such as orchards, wide-row crops or widely spaced individual plants, no general theory exists. This paper contains a description of a general radiative transfer model that is capable of accommodating nearly any canopy structure. The plant canopy is approximated by an array of ellipsoidal subcanopies that may be equally spaced, randomly spaced, or spaced in any manner desired. Ellipsoids were chosen because of the infinite variety of shapes that they can approximate. All of the foliage of any individual subcanopy is contained within the confines of its ellipsoidal subcanopy, and assumed to be statistically distributed within the subcanopy volume with respect to location, foliage angle, and foliage area per unit of subcanopy volume. The radiative transfer model includes attenuation of direct beam and sky diffuse radiation, multiple scattering for visible and near-infrared wavelength, and emission for thermal wavelengths. When the subcanopies overlap extensively, the predictions from the general ellipsoidal model approach the predictions from one-dimensional models applicable to canopies of full cover. Predictions from this three-dimensional model are compared with cross-row measurements in a corn canopy. In addition, sunfleck area and sunlit-leaf area comparisons are made between this three dimensional model and a one dimensional model for a developing corn canopy.},

abstract = {[ 1] We devise a computer efficient and flexible inversion technique to retrieve vegetation canopy parameters, in particular the Leaf Area Index, from the radiance field emerging at the top of a structurally heterogeneous systems overlying an anisotropic spatially uniform surface background. The proposed inversion strategy focuses on a reanalysis of multiangle and multispectral measurements unhindered by the many specific constraints imposed by the operational application of the current algorithms and their associated limitations on data staging. This technique capitalizes on the decoupling between contributions due to the canopy only and those invoking the background reflectance properties. These contributions are decomposed into the wavelength dependent and independent contributions. A quasi-linear relationship is thus obtained between the radiance/reflectance emerging from the top of the canopy layer and the background reflectance. Although all individual contributions can be estimated from accurate three-dimensional radiation transfer models, we propose appropriate approximations in order to estimate the minor terms. These approximations exploit the relatively limited dependency exhibited by these relatively smaller contributions with respect to the azimuthal coordinate. Moreover, additional mathematical developments are proposed to further approximate these terms by their corresponding solutions obtained in the limit case of a plane-parallel turbid medium scenario. They require defining effective values of the state variables entering the plane-parallel turbid medium model. The resulting reflectance of a three-dimensional spatially heterogeneous vegetation layer is driven by a sum of contributions that can be precomputed offline on the basis of the three-dimensional and plane-parallel homogeneous turbid medium model capabilities. The decoupling of the intrinsic vegetation and the background contributions allows many of the contributions to be precomputed and stored in look-up tables. This development yields a simple and computer efficient inversion scheme that allows us to jointly retrieve the values of the main vegetation layer attributes and the underlying background radiative properties. Demonstration tests based on actual multiangular and multispectral data set are currently being investigated.},

abstract = {Effective leaf area index is routinely quantified with optical instruments that measure gap fraction through the probability of beam penetration of sunlight through the vegetation. However, there have been few efforts to obtain theoretically consistent effective leaf area indices from those measurements. To apply the Beer-Lambert law, multiple gap fraction measurements may be averaged in two ways: (1) by taking the mean of the logarithms of the individual gap fraction values or (2) by taking the logarithm of the mean gap fraction. Based on a theoretical model and gap fraction measurements from 41 sites, we report that effective leaf area index must be quantified using the second approach. The first approach implemented in the LAI-2000 instrument considers clumping effects at scales larger than shoots. Thus, the combination of the first approach with an independent clumping index overestimates leaf area index up to 30{\%} at the investigated sites. Clumping effects accounted for by the LAI-2000 instrument, called the "apparent" clumping index, were dependent on canopy cover, crown shape, and canopy height. A forest gap fraction model showed that short canopy height, vertically prolonged crown shape and higher canopy cover are associated with the lowest apparent clumping indices. We show that the apparent clumping index is a useful quantity to constrain the true clumping index and to investigate spatial and temporal variation of clumping effects. Such information would be useful to evaluate a coarse global clumping index map and improve land surface models. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Savannas are spatially heterogeneous, open ecosystems, thus efforts to quantify canopy structure with methods developed for homogeneous, closed canopies are prone to failure. We examine the applicability of two direct (litterfall, allometry) and five indirect (LAI-2000, TRAC, digital hemispheric photography, digital cover photography, traversing radiometer system) methods to determine leaf area index across a 9 ha domain in an oak-savanna ecosystem in California, USA. Interpretation of the leaf area index measurements is supported by two gap-fraction models. We recommend that leaf inclination angle distribution should be characterized first. For this purpose, we propose a simple, reliable and reproducible method using a digital camera. We show that the combination of digital cover photography and LAI-2000 could provide spatially representative leaf area index, gap fraction and element clumping index. Based on these two indirect methods, we quantify spatially representative element clumping index and leaf area index at ecosystem scale as 0.49 ?? 0.10 (mean ?? 95{\%} confidence interval) and 0.77 ?? 0.27, respectively. In contrast to previous studies in northern ecosystems, measurement and modeling results suggest that element clumping index decreases with view zenith angle, most likely due to apparent changes of tree distribution pattern with the view zenith angle. Our results highlight the importance of ecosystem-scale clumping effects for the adequate quantification of tree leaf area index in savannas. Finally, we suggest a protocol to quantify leaf area index and its associated canopy structure variables in open canopy ecosystems. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When crops are grown in mixture systems, microclimate is modified, particularly the light regime. Experiments were conducted in Guadeloupe to examine the variability of the light field and test a light interception model in a traditional forage mixture made of angleton grass savanna planted with rows of gliricidia shrubs. Simulated figures of reflected, transmitted and absorbed PAR were in close agreement with experimental data measurements during the four periods of the study. The model was also used to simulate the influence of row orientation (N-S or E-W), location (North Tropic or Equator), and dates (winter solstice, equinox or summer solstice) on the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The presence of the shrubs strongly decreased the absorbance of the grass, which absorbed between 42{\%} and 50{\%} and 14{\%} and 19{\%}, respectively, in pure and mixed stands. Light capture by gliricidia ranged between 51{\%} and 66{\%}, and was not affected by the presence of the grass. In all cases the interception of the PAR was better for the mixed crop (+15{\%} and +30{\%} more than the pure shrubs and the pure grass, respectively). The influence of the non-photosynthetic organs of the shrubs was limited (about 2{\%}). A simple version of the model is presented, based on a modification of the extinction coefficient instead of the complete calculation of scattering. Differences between the two models are small. Results suggest that the effect of row orientation and season in this kind of perennial forage mixtures is limited. © 1995.},

Uptake rates increased systematically, nearly doubling over the period despite forest age of 75–110 years; there were parallel increases in midsummer photosynthetic capacity at high light level (21.5?31.5 mmole m?2s?1), woody biomass (101?115 Mg-C ha?1 from 1993?2005, mostly due to growth of one species, red oak), and peak leaf area index (4.5?5.5 from 1998–2005). The long-term trends were interrupted in 1998 by sharp declines in photosynthetic capacity, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) ofCO2, and other parameters, with recovery over the next 3 years. The observations were compared to empirical functions giving the mean responses to temperature and light, and to a terrestrial ecosystem model (IBIS2). Variations in gross ecosystem exchange of CO2 (GEE) and NEE on hourly to monthly timescales were represented well as prompt responses to the environment, but interannual variations and long-term trends were not. IBIS2 simulated mean annual NEE, but greatly overpredicted the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and did not predict the decadal trend. The drivers of interannual and decadal changes in NEE are long-term increases in tree biomass, successional change in forest composition, and disturbance events,},

abstract = {Leaf angle distribution is a key parameter to characterize canopy structure and plays a crucial role in controlling energy and mass balance in soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer system. Several leaf angle distribution functions found in literature have been proposed to account for the non-random distribution of leaf inclination angle with one or two parameters. In this paper, these leaf angle distribution functions (Beta distribution function, ellipsoidal function, rotated-ellipsoidal function, Verhoef's algorithm and de Wit's functions) were compared with field data collected in the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) project and two sites within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. All functions performed reasonably well. However, the comparison showed that the two-parameter functions including the Beta distribution function and Verhoef's algorithm commonly were more consistent predictors than one-parameter functions. G-statistics and $\chi$2 test applying to the estimates of leaf angle distribution demonstrated that Beta function presented more robustness over other functions, even the ellipsoidal leaf distribution function which has been widely used. Furthermore, the predictions of leaf angle distribution by these functions were used to calculate extinction coefficient and to separate foliage into sunlit and shaded parts. The results suggested that, ellipsoidal function may be suitable to be retrieved with remotely-sensed data and to compute extinction coefficient and fraction of sunlit foliage because this function requires only a single parameter, namely the ratio of the horizontal semi-axis length to the vertical semi-axis length of an ellipsoid. Finally, the comparison of three approaches (Nilson's, Fuchs' and Ross-Goudriaan's algorithms) for computing extinction coefficient indicated that, there was no significant difference between the three approaches. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Remotely sensed, multiannual data sets of shortwave radiative surface fluxes are now available for assimilation into land surface schemes (LSSs) of climate and/or numerical weather prediction models. The RAMI4PILPS suite of virtual experiments assesses the accuracy and consistency of the radiative transfer formulations that provide the magnitudes of absorbed, reflected, and transmitted shortwave radiative fluxes in LSSs. RAMI4PILPS evaluates models under perfectly controlled experimental conditions in order to eliminate uncertainties arising from an incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the structural, spectral and illumination related canopy characteristics typical for model comparison with in situ observations. More specifically, the shortwave radiation is separated into a visible and near-infrared spectral region, and the quality of the simulated radiative fluxes is evaluated by direct comparison with a 3-D Monte Carlo reference model identified during the third phase of the Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise. The RAMI4PILPS setup thus allows to focus in particular on the numerical accuracy of shortwave radiative transfer formulations and to pinpoint to areas where future model improvements should concentrate. The impact of increasing degrees of structural and spectral subgrid variability on the simulated fluxes is documented and the relevance of any thus emerging biases with respect to gross primary production estimates and shortwave radiative forcings due to snow and fire events are investigated.},

abstract = {The radiation transfer model intercomparison (RAMI) activity aims at assessing the reliability of physics-based radiative transfer (RT) models under controlled experimental conditions. RAMI focuses on computer simulation models that mimic the interactions of radiation with plant canopies. These models are increasingly used in the development of satellite retrieval algorithms for terrestrial essential climate variables (ECVs). Rather than applying ad hoc performance metrics, RAMI-IV makes use of existing ISO standards to enhance the rigor of its protocols evaluating the quality of RT models. ISO-13528 was developed “to determine the performance of individual laboratories for specific tests or measurements.” More specifically, it aims to guarantee that measurement results fall within specified tolerance criteria from a known reference. Of particular interest to RAMI is that ISO-13528 provides guidelines for comparisons where the true value of the target quantity is unknown. In those cases, “truth” must be replaced by a reliable “conventional reference value” to enable absolute performance tests. This contribution will show, for the first time, how the ISO-13528 standard developed by the chemical and physical measurement communities can be applied to proficiency testing of computer simulation models. Step by step, the pre-screening of data, the identification of reference solutions, and the choice of proficiency statistics will be discussed and illustrated with simulation results from the RAMI-IV “abstract canopy” scenarios. Detailed performance statistics of the participating RT models will be provided and the role of the accuracy of the reference solutions as well as the choice of the tolerance criteria will be highlighted.},

abstract = {[1] The Radiation Transfer Model Intercomparison ( RAMI) initiative benchmarks canopy reflectance models under well-controlled experimental conditions. Launched for the first time in 1999, this triennial community exercise encourages the systematic evaluation of canopy reflectance models on a voluntary basis. The first phase of RAMI focused on documenting the spread among radiative transfer (RT) simulations over a small set of primarily 1-D canopies. The second phase expanded the scope to include structurally complex 3-D plant architectures with and without background topography. Here sometimes significant discrepancies were noted which effectively prevented the definition of a reliable ''surrogate truth'', over heterogeneous vegetation canopies, against which other RT models could then be compared. The present paper documents the outcome of the third phase of RAMI, highlighting both the significant progress that has been made in terms of model agreement since RAMI-2 and the capability of/need for RT models to accurately reproduce local estimates of radiative quantities under conditions that are reminiscent of in situ measurements. Our assessment of the self-consistency and the relative and absolute performance of 3-D Monte Carlo models in RAMI-3 supports their usage in the generation of a ''surrogate truth'' for all RAMI test cases. This development then leads ( 1) to the presentation of the ''RAMI Online Model Checker'' (ROMC), an open-access web-based interface to evaluate RT models automatically, and ( 2) to a reassessment of the role, scope, and opportunities of the RAMI project in the future.},

abstract = {[1] Radiation and turbulent energy exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere is an important component of land surface-atmosphere interaction. Vegetation properties strongly influence this exchange. Commonly, two-stream models are used to compute net absorbed radiation and the partitioning of absorbed radiation between the vegetation canopy and substrate. Also, the roughness lengths for momentum and heat are often parameterized as simple functions of vegetation height. In this paper, we examine the influence of vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure on land surface radiation and energy balance over nonuniform forest canopies. To do this, parameterizations that account for the effects of canopy 3-D structure on radiation and turbulent energy exchange were implemented in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) land surface model (LSM) version 1.0. The NCAR LSM then was run offline for a time period encompassing both wet and dry soil moisture conditions using forcing data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Radiation and energy balance within the vegetation canopy and at the soil surface were examined at diurnal timescales. Results show that the 3-D parameterizations increased net radiation absorbed by the soil surface and that this additional available energy was primarily dissipated through ground evaporation when soil moisture was not limiting. When the soil was dry, the available energy at the soil surface was mostly converted to sensible heat with relatively little change in the ground heat flux. In addition, modeled sensible heat from the vegetation canopy decreased, and relatively small changes in modeled canopy transpiration were observed. Comparisons of modeled heat fluxes using the 3-D parameterizations against observations show improvement over the original treatment included in the NCAR LSM, suggesting that careful treatment of vegetation properties is important to accurate modeling of flux quantities above and underneath the canopy in soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) models.},

abstract = {Net solar radiation (Q*) and the partitioning of Q* between vegetation (Q(veg)*) and the substrate (Q(soil)*) are important quantities computed by soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) models. Commonly, two-stream models of canopy radiative transfer are used for this purpose. We examine the validity of this approach for nonuniform canopies and compare estimates of Q*, Q(veg)*, and Q(soil)* computed using a two-stream model with estimates computed using a model that accounts for the effects of three-dimensional (3-D) structure in vegetation on radiative transfer, To accomplish these goals, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for the key input parameters to two-stream canopy radiative transfer models. The parameters examined include leaf area index (L), leaf optical properties, solar zenith angle, leaf orientation, and background albedo. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted using a Geometric-Optical Radiative Transfer (GORT) model. The GORT model treats vegetation canopies as being composed of 3-D crowns and allows for both vertical variation in leaf area and horizontal variation in stem density, Results show that Q* computed by the two-stream model varies by up to 10{\%} relative to the GORT model. Further, the partitioning of Q* between the vegetation canopy and substrate computed by the two-stream model can vary by up to 30{\%} relative to the more realistic GORT model, even for relatively dense canopies (L=6). These differences arise because two-stream models use parameterizations for gap probabilities that are not realistic in discontinuous canopies. Based on this conclusion, a parameterization is proposed to include the effects of canopy heterogeneity in two-stream models, Results from the original two-stream model, a parameterized two-stream model, and the GORT model are compared using data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. These results show that the proposed parameterization captures the effect of 3-D structure in vegetation on radiation regimes and is therefore suitable for inclusion in SVAT models. Inclusion of improved treatment for radiative fluxes in land surface parameterizations should improve modeled estimates for other flux quantities computed by SVAT models.},
