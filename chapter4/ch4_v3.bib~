abstract = {This paper reports the first effort to include carbon, water, and heat exchange in a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model for 3D canopy flows with dynamic response of leaf temperature and stomatal aperture. The LES model simulates eddy motion from 3D, transient integration of a filtered form of the Navier–Stokes equations. Carbon exchange between the vegetation and air is predicted in space and time following biophysical considerations, which act to maximize carbon assimilation while minimizing water loss. The vegetation's stomatal conductance is inferred from these same considerations and used to regulate both transpiration and carbon assimilation rates. Variations in transpiration and radiation distribution propagate to foliage temperature and ultimately heat exchange through a local, transient vegetation energy balance. The wind field is affected by the foliage patterns and by the temperature profile's control on vertical mixing. These temperature and mixing patterns control the concentration profiles that, in turn, affect water and CO2 exchange processes. By comparing a simulation of horizontally heterogeneous canopy behavior to simulations of several homogeneous canopies with different leaf area index (LAI) values we evaluate the relative importance of local and regional LAI values on the local microenvironment variables and fluxes from the forest canopy. We focus on a pine forest with ample soil moisture as a case study. We demonstrate from these simulations that primitive state variables (e.g. concentrations and velocity) exhibit noticeable non-local controls. However, these features are offset in their effects on land surface fluxes, such that the local fluxes scale well with local LAI values. Furthermore, the resulting relationships between LAI and fluxes are quasi-linear (for the forest morphology studied here) allowing for robust relationships between forest averaged LAI and forest averaged fluxes. The offsetting nature of the non-local effects is described in the context of the dual regulation of stomatal conductance by the rates of carbon assimilation and water loss as opposed to independent regulating effects of the various state variables. Hence, non-local variations in state variables naturally induce offsetting variations in stomatal conductance thereby buffering the water use efficiency of the plant from environmental excursions associated with the turbulent microclimate.},

abstract = {The production of high strength steel components with desired properties by hot stamping (also called press hardening) requires a profound knowledge and control of the forming procedures. In this way, the final part properties become predictable and adjustable on the basis of the different process parameters and their interaction. In addition to parameters of conventional cold forming, thermal and microstructural parameters complicate the description of mechanical phenomena during hot stamping, which are essential for the explanation of all physical phenomena of this forming method. In this article, the state of the art in the thermal, mechanical, microstructural, and technological fields of hot stamping are reviewed. The investigations of all process sequences, from heating of the blank to hot stamping and subsequent further processes, are described. The survey of existing works has revealed several gaps in the fields of forming-dependent phase transformation, continuous flow behavior during the whole process, correlation between mechanical and geometrical part properties, and industrial application of some advanced processes. The review aims at providing an insight into the forming procedure backgrounds and shows the great potential for further investigations and innovation in the field of hot sheet metal forming.},

abstract = {For computational expediency, regional and global land-surface models (LSMs), especially those coupled to climate simulations, adopt simple algorithms when calculating radiative transfer (RT) and canopy photosynthesis at the vegetated land surface. Nevertheless, the interaction of sunlight with vegetation is recognized as one of the most critical processes represented in LSMs. The present study calculates global, terrestrial Gross Primary Product (GPP) with a version of the land-surface model JULES which has been modified to take explicit account of sunfleck penetration and leaf orientation within the canopy. A comparison with equivalent simulations adopting the Big Leaf (BL) or two-stream (2ST) RT scheme, indicate that current regional/global LSMs may overestimate GPP by 10{\%} globally and up to 25{\%} regionally. Specifically, their use of average light profiles, and consequent neglect of the dispersion in leaf irradiance, at any given height in the canopy leads to both a general overestimation of canopy light-use efficiency (LUE) and a failure to capture the LUE-enhancement under diffuse sunlight (“diffuse fertilization effect”). We also examine the current limitations of regionally/globally implemented RT schemes with respect to canopy architecture. This is done by coupling JULES to the ray-tracing numerical model FLIGHT, the latter simulating light transfer and photosynthesis in both uniform one-dimensional (1-D) canopies and 3-D tree crowns. When the distribution of leaf nitrogen (N) is configured in a manner consistent with field measurements, output from the 3-D and 1-D FLIGHT simulations is fairly similar (predicted GPP differs by ≤5{\%}). Similarly, both Leaf Angle Distribution (LAD), when restricted to its observed range, and leaf-clumping appear to have a minor influence over canopy productivity. We conclude that current LSMs can radically improve their calculation of regional/global GPP by adopting a multilayer approach. This will allow the separate treatment of sunlit and shaded foliage, at discrete heights within the canopy, as well as the accurate representation of active leaf-N},

abstract = {We conduct a sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of the land-surface scheme JULES focusing on biophysical parameters and model processes that govern light propagation and canopy photosynthesis. We find that current simulations of productivity/energy-exchange are limited as much by their approximate representation of complex physical processes as they are by the accuracy to which their biophysical parameters can be specified. This inference is made for three forest biomes: sparse, boreal needleleaf; dense, tropical broadleaf; and temperate broadleaf of intermediate density. Within the present study, the most influential biophysical parameters are light-limited quantum efficiency ($\alpha$), the Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis at the top of the canopy (V cmax ) and the near-infrared transmittance of vegetation (T NIR ). Assuming respective, current uncertainties of 0.02, 20 $\mu$mol/m2/s and 0.16 in these aforementioned parameters, predictions of Gross Photosynthetic Product (GPP), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H) and upwelling thermal radiation (R) vary by ∼20{\%}, ∼10{\%}, ∼35{\%} and ∼0.3{\%}, respectively. Current representations of canopy photosynthesis and stomatal conductance yield comparable uncertainties in simulated GPP and LE and a ∼60{\%} uncertainty in H. For canopy photosynthesis, explicit treatment of sunfleck penetration and leaf orientation are important elements in the calculation. Of the meteorological variables that drive the land-surface scheme, the downwelling fluxes of radiation in the shortwave and longwave vie in importance with the most influential biophysical parameters. The results from our study are partly biome-dependent. Thus ground albedo and leaf area index (LAI) assume greater importance in sparsely vegetated systems.},

abstract = {To grow, an organism must respire substrates to produce C-skeleton intermediates, usable energy (i.e. ATP), and reducing power [i.e. NAD(P)H] to support biosynthesis and related processes such as active transport of substrates. Respiration is also needed--mainly as a supplier of ATP--to maintain existing biomass in a functional state. As a result, quantifying links between respiration, growth, and maintenance are needed to assess potential plant productivity, to understand plant responses to environmental factors, and as the basis of cost-benefit analyses of alternative uses of photosynthate. Beginning 30 years ago, and continuing for about 5 years, rapid advances were made in understanding and quantifying relationships between respiration and the processes it supports. Progress has continued since then, though often as refinements rather than novel advances. The simplest framework (i.e. paradigm) for relating respiration to other processes divides respiration into growth and maintenance fractions. This often involves a combination of empiricism and mechanism. A three-component framework (growth, maintenance and wastage) has also been considered, although quantifying wastage (theoretically or empirically) remains problematic. The more general and flexible framework, called the general paradigm(GP, herein), relates respiration to any number of individual processes that it supports. The most important processes (from C and energy balance perspectives) identified to date that require respiration are: biosynthesis of new structural biomass, translocation of photosynthate from sources to sinks, uptake of ions from the soil solution, assimilation of N (including N2) and S into organic compounds, protein turnover, and cellular ion-gradient maintenance. In addition, some part of respiration may be associated with wastage (e.g. futile cycles and mitochondrial electron transport uncoupled from oxidative phosphorylation). Most importantly, the GP can (semi-)mechanistically relate respiration to underlying physiology and biochemistry. The GP is more complicated than other approaches to describing or modelling respiration because it is more realistic, complete and mechanistic. This review describes a history of the GP and its present state. Future research questions are suggested. Copyright 2000 Annals of Botany Company},

The modeling framework is applied at local and regional scales over the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) study area in central Iowa, an agricultural landscape that exhibits foliage organization at a variety of levels. Row-scale clumping in area corn- and soybean fields is quantified as a function of view zenith and azimuth angles using ground-based measurements of canopy architecture. The derived clumping indices are used to represent subpixel clumping in Landsat cover estimates at 30-m resolution, which are then aggregated to the 5-km scale of the regional model, reflecting field-to-field variations in vegetation amount. Consideration of vegetation clumping within the thermal model, which affects the relationship between surface temperature and leaf area inputs, significantly improves model estimates of sensible heating at both local and watershed scales in comparison with eddy covariance data collected by aircraft and with a ground-based tower network. These results suggest that this economical approach to representing subpixel leaf area hetereogeneity at multiple scales within the two-source modeling framework works well over the agricultural landscape studied here.},

abstract = {Gap fraction in homogeneous crop canopies is usually computed using the Poisson law. For heterogeneous canopies, gap fraction may be computed by assuming the canopy to be made of contiguous cells, in which the Poisson law is used. However, the implicit hypothesis of random phyto-element position is frequently violated, because of plant structure and canopy planting pattern. This may empirically be taken into account by introducing an additional dispersion parameter. However, we are unable, from a deterministic approach, to predict such a parameter. Most experimental works to study the relations between gap fraction and canopy structure suffer from the limited accuracy of the measurements. A laboratory experiment was therefore conducted on artificial canopies, which enabled an accurate description of both structure and gap fraction. The usual turbid medium approach, with random leaf dispersion, but an accurate description of spatial variations of canopy structure, enabled us to predict the directional gap fraction of the artificial canopies with a maximum error of about 0.06. The accuracy of simulations remained fairly good when using simplified descriptions of structure, provided that they took into account most of the spatial variations of leaf area index. The residual error of 0.06 indicates however a significant departure from the Poisson law. Analysis of spatial and directional dependence of gap fraction measurements showed that fitting simulated and experimental data required the introduction of a dispersion parameter incorporating spatial, zenith, and azimuth variations.},

An important factor not considered in these studies is the case of horizontally heterogeneous plant stands where the ground cover is usually less than 100{\%}. We investigated the relationship between spectral indices and fraction of absorbed PAR in horizontally heterogeneous vegetation canopies with the aid of a three-dimensional radiative transfer model. Canopy reflection at optical wavelengths and PAR absorption was simulated using this model. The errors incurred in using a ID model for calculating the radiation regime of spatially heterogeneous canopies are shown to be significant. Our analysis indicates that the leaf area index of a canopy is less of an instructive parameter than ground cover and clump leaf area index for these canopies. The relationship between normalized difference vegetation index and fraction of absorbed PAR is found to be almost linear and independent of spatial heterogeneity. However, this relationship is sensitive to the reflectance of the soil or background.},

abstract = {Aim We present the first global synthesis of plant canopy leaf area index (LAI) measurements from more than 1000 published estimates representing ∼ 400 unique field sites. LAI is a key variable for regional and global models of biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of energy, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and other materials. Location The location is global, geographically distributed. Results Biomes with LAI values well represented in the liter-ature included croplands, forests and plantations. Biomes not well represented were deserts, shrublands, tundra and wet-lands. Nearly 40{\%} of the records in the database were pub-lished in the past 10 years (1991–2000), with a further 20{\%} collected between 1981 and 1990. Mean (± SD) LAI, distributed between 15 biome classes, ranged from 1.3 ± 0.9 for deserts to 8.7 ± 4.3 for tree plantations, with temperate evergreen forests (needleleaf and broadleaf) displaying the highest average LAI (5.1– 6.7) among the natural terrestrial vegetation classes. Following a statistical outlier analysis, the global mean (± SD) LAI decreased from 5.2 (4.1) to 4.5 (2.5), with a maximum LAI of 18. Biomes with the highest LAI values were planta-tions > temperate evergreen forests > wetlands. Those with the lowest LAI values were deserts < grasslands < tundra. Mean LAI values for all biomes did not differ statistically by the method-ology employed. Direct and indirect measurement approaches produced similar LAI results. Mean LAI values for all biomes combined decreased significantly in the 1990s, a period of substantially more studies and improved methodologies. Main conclusions Applications of the LAI database span a wide range of ecological, biogeochemical, physical, and cli-mate research areas. The data provide input to terrestrial eco-system and land-surface models, for evaluation of global remote sensing products, for comparisons to field studies, and other applications. Example uses of the database for global plant productivity, fractional energy absorption, and remote sensing studies are highlighted.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of land use on differences in air temperature. We based our analysis on a decade of weather and energy flux measurements, collected over two contrasting landscapes, an oak savanna and an annual grassland, growing under the same climate conditions. Over the decade, the daily-averaged, potential air temperature above the aerodynamically rougher and optically darker oak savanna was 0.5°C warmer than that above the aerodynamically smoother and optically brighter annual grassland. However, air temperature differences were seasonal. Smallest differences in potential air temperature occurred towards the end of spring, when much of the soil moisture reservoir was depleted. Largest differences in potential air temperature occurred during the winter rain season when the grass was green and transpiring and when the trees were senescent or deciduous. To understand the effect of land use on the local climate, we examined the concomitant changes in net radiation, sensible and latent heat exchange, the aerodynamic roughness ( R  a ), the surface resistance to water transfer ( R  s ), aerodynamic surface temperature and the growth of the planetary boundary layer, with measurements and model computations. Overall, these biophysical variables provide us with mechanistic information to diagnose and predict how changes in air temperature will follow changes in land use or management. In conclusion, land use change is responsible for having a marked impact on the local climate of a region. At the local level, the change in the surface energy balance, towards a darker and rougher surface, will produce an additive increment to climate warming induced by a greater greenhouse gas burden in the atmosphere.

abstract = {The rate at which isoprene is emitted by a forest depends on an array of environmental variables, the forest's biomass, and its species composition. At present it is unclear whether errors in canopy-scale and process-level isoprene emission models are due to inadequacies in leaf-to-canopy integration theory or the imperfect assessment of the isoprene-emitting biomass in the flux footprint. To address this issue, an isoprene emission model (CANVEG) was tested over a uniform aspen stand and a mixed-species, broad-leaved forest. The isoprene emission model consists of coupled micrometeorological and physiological modules. The micrometeorological module computes leaf and soil energy exchange, turbulent diffusion, scalar concentration profiles, and radiative transfer through the canopy. Environmental variables that are computed by the micrometeorological module, in turn, drive physiological modules that calculate leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration and leaf, bole and soil/root respiration, and rates of isoprene emission. The isoprene emission model accurately predicted the diurnal variation of isoprene emission rates over the boreal aspen stand, as compared with micrometeorological flux measurements. The model's ability to simulate isoprene emission rates over the mixed temperate forest, on the other hand, depended strongly upon the amount of isoprene-emitting biomass, which, in a mixed-species forest, is a function of the wind direction and the horizontal dimensions of the flux footprint. When information on the spatial distribution of biomass and the flux footprint probability distribution function were included, the CANVEG model produced values of isoprene emission that compared well with micrometeorological measurements. The authors conclude that a mass and energy exchange model, which couples flows of carbon, water, and nutrients, can be a reliable tool for integrating leaf-scale, isoprene emission algorithms to the canopy dimension over dissimilar vegetation types as long as the vegetation is characterized appropriately.},

abstract = {Savannas and open grasslands often co-exist in semi-arid regions. Questions that remain unanswered and are of interest to biometeorologists include: how do these contrasting landscapes affect the exchanges of energy on seasonal and annual time scales; and, do biophysical constraints imposed by water supply and water demand affect whether the land is occupied by open grasslands or savanna? To address these questions, and others, we examine how a number of abiotic, biotic and edaphic factors modulate water and energy flux densities over an oak-grass savanna and an annual grassland that coexist in the same climate but on soils with different hydraulic properties. The net radiation balance was greater over the oak woodland than the grassland, despite the fact that both canopies received similar sums of incoming short and long wave radiation. The lower albedo and lower radiative surface temperature of the transpiring woodland caused it to intercept and retain more long and shortwave energy over the course of the year, and particularly during the summer dry period. The partitioning of available energy into sensible and latent heat exchanged over the two canopies differed markedly. The annual sum of sensible heat exchange over the woodland was 40{\%} greater than that over the grassland (2.05GJm -2 per year versus 1.46GJm-2 per year). With regards to evaporation, the oak woodland evaporated about 380mm of water per year and the grassland evaporated about 300mm per year. Differences in available energy, canopy roughness, the timing of physiological functioning, water holding capacity of the soil and rooting depth of the vegetation explained the observed differences in sensible and latent heat exchange of the contrasting vegetation surfaces. The response of canopy evaporation to diminishing soil moisture was quantified by comparing normalized evaporation rates (in terms of equilibrium evaporation) with soil water potential and volumetric water content measurements. When soil moisture was ample normalized values of latent heat flux density were greater for the grassland (1.1-1.2) than for the oak savanna (0.7-0.8) and independent of moisture content. Normalized rates of evaporation over the grassland declined as volumetric water content dropped below 0.15m 3m-3, which corresponded with a soil water potential of -1.5MPa. The grassland senesced and quit transpiring when the volumetric water content of the soil dropped below -2.0MPa. The oak trees, on the other hand, were able to transpire, albeit at low rates, under very dry soil conditions (soil water potentials below -4.0MPa). The trees were able to endure such low water potentials and maintain basal levels of metabolism because ecological forcings kept the tree density and leaf area index of the woodland low, physiological factors forced the stomata to close progressively and the trees were able to tap deeper water sources (below 0.6m) than the grasses. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {How eco-physiological, biogeochemical and micrometeorological theory can be used to compute biosphere-atmosphere, trace gas exchange rates is discussed within the framework of a process model. The accuracy of the theory is tested by comparing computations of mass and energy flux densities (water vapor, sensible heat, CO2 and ozone) against eddy covariance measurements over five distinct canopies (wheat, potato and soybean crops and a temperate broad-leaved and a boreal conifer forest). Once tested, the theory is used to evaluate how interactions between climate and vegetation might influence leaf area and photosynthetic capacity and, in turn, alter energy balance partitioning and the transfer rates of CO2 and other trace gases over vegetation canopies. Model parameters, derived from biogeochemical and eco-physiological principles, enabled the model to estimate rates of mass and energy exchange with reasonable fidelity. In particular, the theory reproduced the magnitudes and distinct diurnal patterns associated with mass and energy fluxes over a spectrum of vegetation types. Model sensitivity tests revealed that variations in leaf area index and photosynthetic capacity interacted to increase rates of evaporation and carbon dioxide and pollutant uptake, greatly, and in a curvilinear manner. Finally, we conclude that the assignment of many model parameters according to plant functional type has much potential for use in global and regional scale ecosystem, climate and biogeochemistry models.},

abstract = {Quantifying and monitoring the structure and degradation of tropical forests over regional to global scales is gaining increasing scientific and societal importance. Reliable automated methods are only beginning to appear; for instance, through the recent development of textural approaches applied to high resolution optical imagery. In particular, the Fourier Transform Textural Ordination (FOTO) method shows some potential to provide non-saturating estimates of tropical forest structure, including for large scale applications. However, we need to understand more precisely how canopy structure interacts with physical signals (light) to produce a given texture, notably to assess the method's sensitivity to varying sun-view acquisition conditions. In this study, we take advantage of the detailed description of canopy topography provided by airborne small footprint LiDAR data acquired over the Paracou forest experimental station in French Guiana. Using hillshade models and a range of sun-view angles identical to the actual parameter distributions found for Quickbird??? images over the Amazon, we study noise and bias in texture estimation induced by the changing configurations. We introduce the bidirectional texture function, which summarizes these effects, and in particular the existence of a textural 'hot spot', similar to a well-known feature of bidirectional reflectance studies. For texture, this effect implies that coarseness decreases in configurations for which shadows are concealed to the observer. We also propose a method, termed partitioned standardization, that allows mitigating acquisition effects and discuss the potential for an operational use of VHR optical imagery and the FOTO method in the current context of international decisions to reduce CO2 emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the parameters used to calculate offsite doses from routine atmospheric tritium releases has been performed. The tests were conducted using MAXIGASP, a site-specific version of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission code GASPAR. The analyses of MAXIGASP were conducted on the version of the code currently in use and on a modified version which incorporates a number of novel parameters. In this application, measured tritium oxide (HTO) release rate and calculated downwind concentration data for the Savannah River Site (SRS) provided the release information required as model input. Parameter assignments for MAXIGASP were made based on Latin Hypercube sampling of each variable over its expected range. Site-specific ranges were used when available. Parameter sensitivity was evaluated based on relative values of rank-transformed correlation coefficients and sensitivity indices. The most sensitive parameter in the current version of MAXIGASP appeared to be the breathing rate. The most sensitive parameters in the modified version were, in descending order of relative importance, the tritium quality factor, the effective half-life of tritium, the breathing rate, and the produce consumption rate. The resulting dose equivalents to a given individual at the site perimeter resulting from a 1.23 x 1010 MBq (3.33 x 105Ci) HTO release were estimated as 1.7 ± 1.0µSv (0.17 ± 0.10 mrem) and 1.6 ± 1.6 µSv (0.16 ± 0.16 mrem) for the current and modified versions of MAXIGASP, respectively. These values represent means and 2s standard deviations at a subjective confidence level of 95{\%} for nominal HTO annual release conditions at the SRS.},

abstract = {The dynamics of soil properties within a 70year old oak plot were assessed every five years (1994-2009), by depth and by horizon to identify short term changes in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, and acidity. The findings were set within a study of long term changes in soil properties in a 180year chronosequence of oak plots from the same forest. Carbon stock increased significantly in the top mineral horizon - overall increase was 5tCha -1, at a mean accumulation rate of 0.34tCha -1y -1, which was mainly due to increase in horizon thickness. No increase was seen when soils were sampled by depth. Differences obtained by depth or horizon sampling due to changes in horizon thickness over time highlight the importance of horizon in the correct evaluation of soil property change in small scale sampling programs. This is particularly important in forest soils with high litter accumulation and low turnover rates when compared to other land uses. Nitrogen stock increases below 10cm soil depth were attributed to insect activity, litterfall variation and a change in water table. Findings were confirmed in the chronosequence study of oak across the forests; increases in soil C stocks of 0.1-0.2tCha -1y -1 were calculated across young ({\~{}}25years), mid-rotation ({\~{}}60years) and old (120+ years) stands. Soil nitrogen increased significantly with canopy age whilst pH increased significantly between young-mid rotation stands but decreased between mid rotation and old stands. Significant increases in pH were also recorded before 2004 in the ECN 70year old oak plots reflecting overall pollution recovery. ?? 2012.},

These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.},

Comparisons were limited to the average diurnal cycle for these periods to mitigate large day-to-day variability in the observations and problems with missing data. For consistency with the global implementation of the model, vegetation and soil parameters were not set to site-specific values but rather were the generic needleleaf evergreen and broadleaf deciduous vegetation and the generic sandy and loamy soil used in the global model. Despite the use of generic vegetation and soil, the model reasonably simulated the diurnal cycle of sensible heat, latent heat, net radiation, and CO2 fluxes for the SSA- OJP and SSA-OA sites. The main errors were that the model did not reproduce the midday reduction in latent heat seen at the SSA-OJP site during IFC-1 and IFC-2 and had less photosynthetic CO2 uptake than observed at the SSA-OA site. Differences in vegetation structure and physiology between the two sites were important to accurately simulate the fluxes. The needleleaf evergreen vegetation resulted in higher net radiation and a higher Bowen ratio than the broadleaf deciduous vegetation. Soil differences were less important. The NSA-OJP site was not so well simulated: midday latent heat flux was overestimated, and photosynthetic CO2 uptake was underestimated during each IFC. The only difference in the simulated southern and northern jack pine sites was in their atmospheric forcings; vegetation structure and soil types were the same. These results suggest the model is able to reproduce variability between vegetation types but not within vegetation types.},

abstract = {In complex architecture canopies, the diffuse solar radiation can enhance photosynthetic capacity, as it penetrates more efficiently on them. Although several studies have been conducted on this topic over the world, the mechanisms and impacts of the "diffuse fertilization effect" over South America still remains poorly understood. The Amazon Deforestation Arch provides an ideal scenario for its further investigation, by the presence of complex ecosystems and by the large amounts of aerosols released into the atmosphere due to biomass burning. A study based on three different sites in the Amazon Deforestation Arch was conducted in order to relate the aerosol optical depth with some surface fluxes. The results showed significant effects of the aerosol presence in both, the exchange of carbon dioxide between the vegetation and the atmosphere, and the energy exchange. Still, the fluxes also showed to be sensitive to changes in temperature, humidity and wind velocities, as well as the influence of the diurnal cycle itself. In hypothetical scenarios, it was possible to isolate only the aerosol effect. The carbon dioxide flux behavior due to the aerosol presence was not the same for all the three locations, showing that it depends on the local vegetation characteristics. At the Jaru Biological Reserve and Bananal Island, the carbonic gas exchanges between the atmosphere and the surface increased under the aerosol presence, achieving values up to 55{\%} higher in Jaru. However, Sinop showed a decrease by approximately 12{\%} in the average value of the carbon dioxide flux for the evaluated period. Energy fluxes showed to be negatively affected by the presence of aerosols. In the Bananal Island the average of sensitive heat flux in scenarios without aerosols was around 60{\%} higher, and up to 13{\%} higher for the latent heat flux in Sinop. Due to absorption and scattering of solar radiation by the aerosols, less energy reaches the surface, and therefore there is less availability to perform such exchanges, as expected.},

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is the total one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area. It is a key parameter in ecophysiology, especially for scaling up the gas exchange from leaf to canopy level. It characterizes the canopy-atmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. It is also one of the most difficult to quantify properly, owing to large spatial and temporal variability. Many methods have been developed to quantify LAI from the ground and some of them are also suitable for describing other structural parameters of the canopy. This paper reviews the direct and indirect methods, the required instruments, their advantages, disadvantages and accuracy of the results. Analysis of the literature shows that most cross-validations between direct and indirect methods have pointed to a significant underestimation of LAI with the latter techniques, especially in forest stands. The two main causes for the discrepancy, clumping and contribution of stem and branches, are discussed and some recent theoretical or technical solutions are presented as potential improvements to reduce bias or discrepancies. The accuracy, sampling strategy and spatial validity of the LAI measurements have to be assessed for quality assurance of both the measurement and the modelling purposes of all the LAI-dependent ecophysiological and biophysical processes of canopies.},

abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an invaluable tool for the structured environmental impact assessment of bioenergy product systems. However, the methodology's static temporal and spatial scope combined with its restriction to emission-based metrics in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) inhibits its effectiveness at assessing climate change impacts that stem from dynamic land surface-atmosphere interactions inherent to all biomass-based product systems. In this paper, we focus on two dynamic issues related to anthropogenic land use that can significantly influence the climate impacts of bioenergy systems: i) temporary changes to the terrestrial carbon cycle; and ii) temporary changes in land surface albedo-and illustrate how they can be integrated within the LCA framework. In the context of active land use management for bioenergy, we discuss these dynamics and their relevancy and outline the methodological steps that would be required to derive case-specific biogenic CO 2 and albedo change characterization factors for inclusion in LCIA. We demonstrate our concepts and metrics with application to a case study of transportation biofuel sourced from managed boreal forest biomass in northern Europe. We derive GWP indices for three land management cases of varying site productivities to illustrate the importance and need to consider case- or region-specific characterization factors for bioenergy product systems.

abstract = {In recent generation Earth system models (ESMs), land-surface grid cells are represented as tiles covered by different plant functional types such as trees or grasses. Here, we present an evaluation of the vegetation-cover module of the ESM developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany (MPI-ESM) for present-day conditions. The vegetation continuous fields (VCF) product that is based on satellite observations in 2001 is used to evaluate the fractional distributions of woody vegetation cover and bare ground. The model performance is quantified using two metrics: a square of the Pearson correlation coefficient, r2, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). On a global scale, r2 and RMSE of modeled tree cover are equal to 0.61 and 0.19, respectively, which we consider as satisfactory values. The model simulates tree cover and bare ground with r2 higher for the Northern Hemisphere (0.66) than for the Southern Hemisphere (0.48–0.50). We complement this analysis with an evaluation of the simulated land-surface albedo using the difference in net surface radiation. On a global scale, the correlation between modeled and observed albedos is high during all seasons, whereas the main disagreement occurs in spring in the high northern latitudes. This discrepancy can be attributed to a high sensitivity of the land-surface albedo to the simulated snow cover and snow-masking effect of trees. By contrast, the tropics are characterized by very high correlation and relatively low RMSE (5.4–6.5 W/m2) during all seasons. The presented approach could be applied for an evaluation of vegetation cover and land-surface albedo simulated by different ESMs.},

abstract = {A spatially explicit 3-D model of crown geometry is combined with a radiative transfer model for heterogeneous media to predict the transmittance of a discontinuous Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) canopy under different architectural assumptions. The canopy gap fraction was sampled with a Plant Canopy Analyser (PCA; LAI 2000, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at 200 regularly spaced points in the understorey. A comparison of predicted and observed values of diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) shows that the above model can predict most of the spatial variability of the diffuse fluxes (R2 = 0.97). In order to evaluate the variation in light penetration due to needle clumping in shoots, two architectural hypotheses are tested: random distribution of needles (scenario 1) and of shoots (scenario 2) within crowns. Results indicate that the variability in the radiative fluxes due to shoot architecture is rather limited in comparison with the variability generated by canopy discontinuities. However, assuming shoots as the basic foliage element slightly improves the model performance. The predictive accuracy for the two architectural hypotheses is similar, with a mean absolute percent error of 12.2 and 12.0{\%} for scenarios 1 and 2; respectively. The predictive bias is almost equivalent in magnitude but opposite in sign (mean percent error of -4.82 and 3.55{\%} for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively). The underestimation of the DIFN in the first scenario suggests that, when needles are considered as basic foliage elements, the spatial distribution is not random, but clumped. On the contrary, the overestimation of DIFN in scenario 2 indicates that the spatial distribution of shoots is more regular than random. The angular distribution of the predictive error in the bands of the PCA suggests that the angular distribution of the shoot normal was more ellipsoidal than the spherical one adopted in the simulation, while leaf clumping in whorls appears to be the source of the high gap fraction at larger zenith angles.},

abstract = {It is suggested that the high albedo of a desert contributes to a net radiative heat loss relative to its surroundings and that the resultant horizontal temperature gradients induce a frictionally controlled circulation which imports heat aloft and maintains thermal equilibrium through sinking motion and adiabatic compression. In the subtropics this sinking motion is superimposed on the descending branch of the mean Hadley circulation but is more intense. Thus the desert feeds back upon itself in an important manner. If one takes into account the biosphere, this feedback mechanism could conceivably lead to instabilities or metastabilities in desert border regions. It is argued that a reduction of vegetation, with consequent increase in albedo, in the Sahel region at the southern margin of the Sahara would cause sinking motion, additional drying, and would therefore perpetuate the arid conditions. Numerical integrations with the general circulation model of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies appear to substantiate this hypothesis. Increasing the albedo north of the ITCZ from 14{\%} to 35{\%} had the effect of shifting the ITCZ several degrees of latitude south and decreasing the rainfall in the Sahel about 40{\%} during the rainy season.},

abstract = {Abstract{\&}nbsp;{\&}nbsp;We describe pragmatic and reliable methods to examine the influence of patch-scale heterogeneities on the uncertainty in long-term eddy-covariance (EC) carbon flux data and to scale between the carbon flux estimates derived from land surface optical remote sensing and directly derived from EC flux measurements on the basis of the assessment of footprint climatology. Three different aged Douglas-fir stands with EC flux towers located on Vancouver Island and part of the Fluxnet Canada Research Network were selected. Monthly, annual and interannual footprint climatologies, unweighted or weighted by carbon fluxes, were produced by a simple model based on an analytical solution of the Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. The dimensions and orientation of the flux footprint depended on the height of the measurement, surface roughness length, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric stability. The weighted footprint climatology varied with the different carbon flux components and was asymmetrically distributed around the tower, and its size and spatial structure significantly varied monthly, seasonally and inter-annually. Gross primary productivity (GPP) maps at 10-m resolution were produced using a tower-mounted multi-angular spectroradiometer, combined with the canopy structural information derived from airborne laser scanning (Lidar) data. The horizontal arrays of footprint climatology were superimposed on the 10-m-resolution GPP maps. Monthly and annual uncertainties in EC flux caused by variations in footprint climatology of the 59-year-old Douglas-fir stand were estimated to be approximately 15–20{\%} based on a comparison of GPP estimates derived from EC and remote sensing measurements, and on sensor location bias analysis. The footprint-variation-induced uncertainty in long-term EC flux measurements was mainly dependent on the site spatial heterogeneity. The bias in carbon flux estimates using spatially-explicit ecological models or tower-based remote sensing at finer scales can be estimated by comparing the footprint-weighted and EC-derived flux estimates. This bias is useful for model parameter optimizing. The optimization of parameters in remote-sensing algorithms or ecosystem models using satellite data will, in turn, increase the accuracy in the upscaled regional carbon flux estimation.},

abstract = {The feasibility of detecting the seasonal variation in leaf area index (LAI) in boreal conifer forests is investigated using optical instruments. The LAI of six stands was measured. They include young and old jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and old black spruce (Picea mariana) located near the southern border (near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan) and near the northern border (near Thompson, Manitoba) of the Canadian boreal ecotone. LAI values of the stands are obtained by making several corrections to the effective LAI measured from the LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA). The corrections include a foliage element (shoot) clumping index (for clumping at scales larger than the shoot) measured using the optical instrument TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies) developed by Chen and Cihlar (Chen, J.M. and Cihlar, J., 1995a, Plant canopy gap size analysis theory for improving optical measurements of leaf area index of plant canopies, Appl. Opt., 34: 6211–6222), a needle-to-shoot area ratio (for clumping within the shoot) obtained from shoot samples, and a woody-to-total area ratio obtained through destructive sampling of trees. It is found that the effective LAI varied about 5{\%} to 10{\%} in the growing season and the element clumping index remained almost unchanged. The needle-to-shoot area ratio varied the most, about 15{\%} to 25{\%}, which is of the same order of magnitude as the expected seasonal variability in LAI. This demonstrates that most of the seasonal variation information is contained in the needle-to-shoot area ratio, which can not be measured indirectly using in situ optical instruments and has to be obtained from a large quantity of shoot sample analysis which is laborious and error-prone. Based on our experience, an improved and convenient shoot sampling strategy is suggested for future studies. The optically-based LAI values were compared with destructive sampling results for three of the stands. Based on error analysis, we believe that optical measurements combined with shoot sample analysis can produce LAI values for conifer stands which are more accurate than destructive sampling results.},

abstract = {Global mapping of the vegetation clumping index is attempted for the first time using multi-angular POLDER 1 data based on a methodology that has been demonstrated to be applicable to Canada's landmass. The clumping index quantified the level of foliage grouping within distinct canopy structures, such as tree crowns, shrubs, and row crops, relative to a random distribution. Vegetation foliage clumping significantly alters its radiation environment and therefore affects vegetation growth as well as water and carbon cycles. The clumping index is useful in ecological and meteorological models because it provides new structural information in addition to the effective LAI retrieved from mono-angle remote sensing and allows accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves in the canopy. The relationship between an angular index (normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot) and the clumping index is explored using a geometrical optical model named "4-Scale". A simplified version of the mechanistic hotspot model used in 4-Scale is developed to derive the hotspot reflectance from multi-angle measurements for mapping purposes. An accurate clumping map for areas with significant tree (shrub) covers has been achieved, although further research is required to reduce topographic effects. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In recent years, the methodology in ground-based optical measurements of leaf area index (LAI) of plant canopies has been substantially improved after the introduction of canopy gap size analysis methods. In this paper, the two methods by Chen and Black [9] and Chen and Cihlar [10] are compared for four boreal conifer stands located near Prince Albert, Saskachewan, and Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. The data used in the analysis were obtained from a new sunfleck-LAI instrument, the TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Achitecture of Canopies), which measures the photosynthetic photon flux density along transects beneath the overstory at a rate of 100 samples per meter. It is confirmed in this study that the needle shoots of conifer trees can be treated as the basic foliage units (elements) for radiation interception considerations. The effect of foliage clumping at scales larger than the shoots is quantified using an element dumping index. This is necessary for indirect measurements of LAI based on the gap fraction principle using optical instruments such as the LI-COR LAI-2000. The values of element clumping index derived from these two methods agree within 17{\%} for all stands investigated. However, the values obtained using Chen and Black's method are consistently smaller than those calculated using Chen and Cihlar's method. The difference results from a negative bias introduced in the method of Chen and Black which requires the assumption for a random spatial distribution of foliage clumps (tree crowns). The method of Chen and Cihlar makes no assumption of foliage distribution patterns and is therefore more reliable. Yet, Chen and Black's method allows the derivation of several canopy architectural parameters which are useful for modeling radiative regimes in forest canopies. It is concluded that for remote sensing and other studies, a large quantity of ground truth LAI data can be acquired quickly and accurately using a combination of indirect optical measurements by the LAI-2000 for the foliage angular distribution and the TRAC for the foliage spatial distribution.},

abstract = {Because Farquhar's photosynthesis model is only directly applicable to individual leaves instantaneously, considerable skill is needed to use this model for regional plant growth and carbon budget estimations. In many published models, Farquhar's equations were applied directly to plant canopies by assuming a plant canopy to function like a big-leaf. This big-leaf approximation is found to be acceptable for estimating seasonal trends of canopy photosynthesis but inadequate for simulating its day-to-day variations, when compared with eddy-covariance and gas-exchange chamber measurements from two boreal forests. The daily variation is greatly dampened in big-leaf simulations because the original leaf-level model is partially modified through replacing stomatal conductance with canopy conductance. Alternative approaches such as separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups or stratifying the canopy into multiple layers can avoid the problem. Because of non-linear response of leaf photosynthesis to meteorological variables (radiation, temperature and humidity), considerable errors exist in photosynthesis calculation at daily steps without considering the diurnal variability of the variables. To avoid these non-linear effects, we have developed an analytical solution to a simplified daily integral of Farquhar's model by considering the general diurnal patterns of meteorological variables. This daily model not only captures the main effects of diurnal variations on photosynthesis but is also computationally efficient for large area applications. Its application is then not restricted by availability of sub-daily meteorological data. This scheme has been tested using measured CO, data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), which took place in Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 1994 and 1996. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Neyman distribution which is able to model the patchiness or clumpiness
of a forest stand; 2) the multiple mutual shadowing effect between tree
crowns is considered using a negative binomial and the Neyman
distribution theory; 3) the effect of the sunlit background is modeled
using a canopy gap size distribution function that affects the magnitude

directional reflectance is simulated using a simple angular radiation
penetration function; and 5) the tree crown surface is treated as a
complex surface with microscale structures which themselves generate
mutual shadows and a hotspot. All these scales of canopy architecture

abstract = {Sunlit and shaded leaf separation proposed by Norman (1982) is an effective way to upscale from leaf to canopy in modeling vegetation photosynthesis. The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) makes use of this methodology, and has been shown to be reliable in modeling the gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from CO2flux and tree ring measurements. In this study, we use BEPS to investigate the effect of canopy architecture on the global distribution of GPP. For this purpose, we use not only leaf area index (LAI) but also the first ever global map of the foliage clumping index derived from the multiangle satellite sensor POLDER at 6 km resolution. The clumping index, which characterizes the degree of the deviation of 3-dimensional leaf spatial distributions from the random case, is used to separate sunlit and shaded LAI values for a given LAI. Our model results show that global GPP in 2003 was 132 ± 22 Pg C. Relative to this baseline case, our results also show: (1) global GPP is overestimated by 12{\%} when accurate LAI is available but clumping is ignored, and (2) global GPP is underestimated by 9{\%} when the effective LAI is available and clumping is ignored. The clumping effects in both cases are statistically significant (p < 0.001). The effective LAI is often derived from remote sensing by inverting the measured canopy gap fraction to LAI without considering the clumping. Global GPP would therefore be generally underestimated when remotely sensed LAI (actually effective LAI by our definition) is used. This is due to the underestimation of the shaded LAI and therefore the contribution of shaded leaves to GPP. We found that shaded leaves contribute 50{\%}, 38{\%}, 37{\%}, 39{\%}, 26{\%}, 29{\%} and 21{\%} to the total GPP for broadleaf evergreen forest, broadleaf deciduous forest, evergreen conifer forest, deciduous conifer forest, shrub, C4 vegetation, and other vegetation, respectively. The global average of this ratio is 35{\%}.},

To determine foliage clumping within conifer shoots, a video camera and rotational light table system was used. The major difficulties in determining the surface area of small conifer needles have been largely overcome by the use of an accurate volume displacement method.

abstract = {Simple but realistic modeling of radiation transfer within heterogeneous canopy has been a challenging research question for decades and is critical for predicting ecological processes such as photosynthesis. The Markov model proposed by [Nilson, T., 1971. A theoretical analysis of the frequency of gaps in plant stands. Agric. Meteorol. 8, 25-38] is theoretically sound to meet this challenge. However, it has not been widely used because of the difficulty of determining the clumping factor. We propose an analytical approach to calculate clumping factors based on the average characteristics of vegetation distributed across a landscape. In a savanna woodland in California, we simulate the photosynthesis of the landscape in three different ways: (1) the crown envelope and location of each tree is spatially explicitly specified, (2) the canopy is assumed to be horizontally homogeneous within which leaves are randomly dispersed as a Poisson process, and (3) the canopy is horizontally homogeneous but leaves are clumped and distributed with a Markov process. We find that the Markov model can achieve much better performance than the Poisson model by incorporating the crown-level clumping. The results indicate that our approach of calculating clumping factors has applications in terrestrial ecosystem modeling, particularly where accurate representation of "system heterogeneity" (e.g., savannas and woodlands) is required. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) is a process-based model that simulates the fluxes of carbon, water, energy and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere. Many studies have demonstrated the important role of the land surface in the functioning of the Earth System. Different versions of JULES have been employed to quantify the effects on the land carbon sink of climate change, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, changing atmospheric aerosols and tropospheric ozone, and the response of methane emissions from wetlands to climate change. This paper describes the consolidation of these advances in the modelling of carbon fluxes and stores, in both the vegetation and soil, in version 2.2 of JULES. Features include a multi-layer canopy scheme for light interception, including a sunfleck penetration scheme, a coupled scheme of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, representation of the effects of ozone on leaf physiology, and a description of methane emissions from wetlands. JULES represents the carbon allocation, growth and population dynamics of five plant functional types. The turnover of carbon from living plant tissues is fed into a 4-pool soil carbon model. The process-based descriptions of key ecological processes and trace gas fluxes in JULES mean that this community model is well-suited for use in carbon cycle, climate change and impacts studies, either in standalone mode or as the land component of a coupled Earth system model.},

abstract = {[1] Scattering and absorption of sunlight by anthropogenic aerosols reduce the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) incident upon the Earth's surface, but increase the fraction of the PAR that is diffuse. These alterations to irradiance may elicit conflicting responses in terrestrial plants: photosynthesis and net primary productivity (NPP) are slowed by reductions in total PAR, but enhanced by increases in diffuse PAR. In this paper, we use two canopy photosynthesis models to estimate the net effect of aerosols on carbon assimilation by green plants during summertime at midlatitudes. The model calculations indicate that the net effect of PAR scattering and absorption by atmospheric aerosols on NPP can be positive, neutral, or negative. Two parameters that strongly influence the net effect are the aerosol optical depth (integral of light extinction with height) and the cloud cover. On cloudless days NPP peaks under moderately thick aerosol loadings. On overcast days, aerosols slow NPP. The implications of these results for various regions of the globe and possible directions for future studies on the effect of aerosols on plant growth are discussed.},

abstract = {Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy balance. Since C4 metabolism shows unique responses to environmental conditions and C4 species are important agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf model specific to C4 plants is needed. In this paper we develop a simple model for predicting A(n) and g from leaves Of C4 plants that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the important environmental responses. We derive the leaf model from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model Of C4 photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O2 between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats A(n) as first order with respect to either light, CO2 or the amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (T(l)), intercellular CO2 levels and the absorbed quantum flux. A simple linear model of g in terms of A(n) and leaf surface CO2 level (p(s)) and relative humidity (h(s)) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T(l) and p(s), and h(s) levels. Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO2 and temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown to be highly correlated with the data. Under most conditions the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional status and water stress levels on A(n) and g can be accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix CO2. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO2 and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this purpose.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20–35°C), CO2 concentrations (10–90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5–3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100–2000 $\mu$mol m−2s−1). The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the ‘big-leaf’ approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of $\lambda$E and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and $\lambda$E. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and $\lambda$E. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

abstract = {Recent improvements to the Hadley Centre climate model include the introduction of a new land surface scheme called MOSES (Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme). MOSES is built on the previous scheme, but incorporates in addition an interactive plant photosynthesis and conductance module, and a new soil thermodynamics scheme which simulates the freezing and melting of soil water, and takes account of the dependence of soil thermal characteristics on the frozen and unfrozen components. The impact of these new features is demonstrated by comparing 1×CO2 and 2×CO2 climate simulations carried out using the old (UKMO) and new (MOSES) land surface schemes. MOSES is found to improve the simulation of current climate. Soil water freezing tends to warm the high-latitude land in the northern Hemisphere during autumn and winter, whilst the increased soil water availability in MOSES alleviates a spurious summer drying in the mid-latitudes. The interactive canopy conductance responds directly to CO2, supressing transpiration as the concentration increases and producing a significant enhancement of the warming due to the radiative effects of CO2 alone.},

abstract = {This paper compares the predictions by two radiative transfer models—the two-stream approximation model and the generalized layered model (developed by the authors) in land surface processes—for different canopies under direct or diffuse radiation conditions. The comparison indicates that there are significant differences between the two models, especially in the near infrared (NIR) band. Results of canopy reflectance from the two-stream model are larger than those from the generalized model. However, results of canopy absorptance from the two-stream model are larger in some cases and smaller in others compared to those from the generalized model, depending on the cases involved. In the visible (VIS) band, canopy reflectance is smaller and canopy absorptance larger from the two-stream model compared to the generalized model when the Leaf Area Index (LAI) is low and soil reflectance is high. In cases of canopies with vertical leaf angles, the differences of reflectance and absorptance in the VIS and NIR bands between the two models are especially large. Two commonly occurring cases, with which the two-stream model cannot deal accurately, are also investigated. One is for a canopy with different adaxial and abaxial leaf optical properties; and the other is for incident sky diffuse radiation with a non-uniform distribution. Comparison of the generalized model within the same canopy for both uniform and non-uniform incident diffuse radiation inputs shows smaller differences in general. However, there is a measurable difference between these radiation inputs for a canopy with high leaf angle. This indicates that the application of the two-stream model to a canopy with different adaxial and abaxial leaf optical properties will introduce non-negligible errors.},

abstract = {The energy exchange, evapotranspiration, and carbon exchange by plant canopies depend on leaf stomatal control. The treatment of this control has been required by land components of climate and carbon models. Physiological models can be used to simulate the responses of stomatal conductance to changes in atmospheric and soil environments. Big-leaf models that treat a canopy as a single leaf tend to overestimate fluxes of CO2 and water vapor. Models that differentiate between sunlit and shaded leaves largely overcome these problems. A one-layered, two-big-leaf submodel for photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, and energy fluxes is presented in this paper. It includes 1) an improved two stream approximation model of radiation transfer of the canopy, with attention to singularities in its solution and with separate integrations of radiation absorption by sunlit and shaded fractions of canopy; 2) a photosynthesis–stomatal conductance model for sunlit and shaded leaves separately, and for the simultaneous transfers of CO2 and water vapor into and out of the leaf—leaf physiological properties (i.e., leaf nitrogen concentration, maximum potential electron transport rate, and hence photosynthetic capacity) vary throughout the plant canopy in response to the radiation–weight time-mean profile of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and the soil water limitation is applied to both maximum rates of leaf carbon uptake by Rubisco and electron transport, and the model scales up from leaf to canopy separately for all sunlit and shaded leaves; 3) a well-built quasi-Newton–Raphson method for simultaneous solution of temperatures of the sunlit and shaded leaves. The model was incorporated into the Common Land Model (CLM) and is denoted CLM 2L. It was driven with observational atmospheric forcing from two forest sites [Anglo-Brazilian Amazonian Climate Observation Study (ABRACOS) and Boreal Ecosystem–Atmosphere Study (BOREAS)] for 2 yr of simulation. The simulated fluxes by CLM 2L were compared with the observations, and with the results by the CLM with a single big- leaf scheme (CLM 1L) and by the CLM with the assimilation–stomatal conductance scheme of NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM). The results showed that CLM 2L was an improvement compared to the CLM 1L and the CLM for the test cases of tropical evergreen broadleaf land cover and coniferous boreal forest.},

LAI is a controlling biophysical property of vegetation function, and quantifying LAI is thus vital for understanding energy, carbon and water fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. LAI is routinely available from Earth Observation (EO) instruments such as MODIS. However EO-derived estimates of LAI require validation before they are utilised by the ecosystem modelling community. Previous validation work on the MODIS collection 4 (c4) product suggested considerable error especially in forested biomes, and as a result significant modification of the MODIS LAI algorithm has been made for the most recent collection 5 (c5). As a result of these changes the current MODIS LAI product has not been widely validated. We present a validation of the MODIS c5 LAI product over a 121km
                        2 area of mixed coniferous forest in Oregon, USA, based on detailed ground measurements which we have upscaled using high resolution EO data. Our analysis suggests that c5 shows a much more realistic temporal LAI dynamic over c4 values for the site we examined. We find improved spatial consistency between the MODIS c5 LAI product and upscaled in situ measurements. However results also suggest that the c5 LAI product underestimates the upper range of upscaled in situ LAI measurements. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Their utility, and, more speciﬁcally, MC ray tracing for the numerical simulation of the radiation ﬁeld within a vegetation canopy, are outlined. General issues pertinent to implementation and exploitation of such methods are discussed, such as the descriptions of canopy structure and radiometric properties required for their use. Strategies for the reduction of variance, which form the core of the application of MC methods to canopy reﬂectance modelling are presented, and examples given of the type of information which may be obtained from canopy reﬂectance modelling using MC ray tracing. The use of MC methods in the development of models of canopy development, driven by fundamental properties such as radiation interception are discussed.},

abstract = {Two techniques of uncertainty analysis were applied to a mathematical model that estimates the dose-equivalent to man from the concentration of radioactivity in air, water, and food. The response-surface method involved screening of the model to determine the important parameters, development of the response-surface equation, calculating the moments using the response-surface model, and fitting a Pearson or Johnson distribution using the calculated moments. The second method sampled model inputs by Latin hypercube methods and iteratively simulated the model to obtain an empirical estimation of the cdf. Comparison of the two methods indicates that it is often difficult to ascertain the adequacy or reliability of the response-surface method. The empirical method is simpler to implement and, because all model inputs are included in the analysis, it is also a more reliable estimator of the cumulative distribution function of the model output than the response-surface method.

abstract = {Process-based models (PBMs) of vegetation function can be used to interpret and integrate experimental results. Water limitation to plant carbon uptake is a highly uncertain process in the context of environmental change, and many experiments have been carried out that study drought limitations to vegetation function at spatial scales from seedlings to entire canopies. What is lacking in the synthesis of these experiments is a quantitative tool incorporating a detailed mechanistic representation of the water balance that can be used to integrate and analyse experimental results at scales of both the whole-plant and the forest canopy. To fill this gap, we developed an individual tree-based model (MAESPA), largely based on combining the well-known MAESTRA and SPA ecosystem models. The model includes a hydraulically-based model of stomatal conductance, root water uptake routines, drainage, infiltration, runoff and canopy interception, as well as detailed radiation interception and leaf physiology routines from the MAESTRA model. The model can be applied both to single plants of arbitrary size and shape, as well as stands of trees. The utility of this model is demonstrated by studying the interaction between elevated [CO2] (eCa) and drought. Based on theory, this interaction is generally expected to be positive, so that plants growing in eCa should be less susceptible to drought. Experimental results, however, are varied. We apply the model to a previously published experiment on droughted cherry, and show that changes in plant parameters due to long-term growth at eCa (acclimation) may strongly affect the outcome of Ca × drought experiments. We discuss potential applications of MAESPA and some of the key uncertainties in process representation.},

abstract = {Isoprene is important in atmospheric chemistry, but its seasonal emission pattern - especially in the tropics, where most isoprene is emitted - is incompletely understood. We set out to discover generalized relationships applicable across many biomes between large-scale isoprene emission and a series of potential predictor variables, including both observed and model-estimated variables related to gross primary production (GPP) and canopy temperature. We used remotely sensed atmospheric concentrations of formaldehyde, an intermediate oxidation product of isoprene, as a proxy for isoprene emission in 22 regions selected to span high to low latitudes, to sample major biomes, and to minimize interference from pyrogenic sources of volatile organic compounds that could interfere with the isoprene signal. Formaldehyde concentrations showed the highest average seasonal correlations with remotely sensed (r = 0.85) and model-estimated (r = 0.80) canopy temperatures. Both variables predicted formaldehyde concentrations better than air temperature (r = 0.56) and a "reference" isoprene model that combines GPP and an exponential function of temperature (r = 0.49), and far better than either remotely sensed green vegetation cover, fPAR (r = 0.25) or model-estimated GPP (r = 0.14). Gross primary production in tropical regions was anti-correlated with formaldehyde concentration (r = -0.30), which peaks during the dry season. Our results were most reliable in the tropics, where formaldehyde observational errors were the least. The tropics are of particular interest because they are the greatest source of isoprene emission as well as the region where previous modelling attempts have been least successful. We conjecture that positive correlations of isoprene emission with GPP and air temperature (as found in temperate forests) may arise simply because both covary with canopy temperature, peaking during the relatively short growing season. The lack of a general correlation between GPP and formaldehyde concentration in the seasonal cycle is consistent with experimental evidence that isoprene emission rates are largely decoupled from photosynthetic rates, and with the likely adaptive significance of isoprene emission in protecting leaves against heat damage and oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Canopy architecture, the geometric organization of aboveground vegetation, provides an essential link between patterns observable by remote sensing and fundamental ecological processes. As part of the international Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS); (1) we developed a hierarchical approach for sampling canopy architecture, and (2) we acquired a comprehensive data set for characterizing canopy architecture for the major BOREAS study sites. The approach involves a series of four sets of measurements at different spatial scales, ranging from the ecosystem to the leaf level: (1) regional characterization, involving measurements of the climate, ecosystem, and landscape features; (2) stand characterization, involving measurements of crown geometry (diameter at breast height (DBH), height, and crown extent), individual tree location, and understory cover; (3) tree vectorization, involving detailed sampling of the three-dimensional distribution of canopy elements and crown form; and (4) characterization of canopy geometry as seen from beneath, involving acquisition of a multitemporal catalog of hemispherical photographs. The last three sets of measurements were then used to reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of the canopy. By comparing simulated hemispherical views upward from beneath this reconstructed canopy with in situ hemispherical photographs, the methodological approach was validated. Simulated photographs faithfully reproduced patterns observed for in situ hemispherical photographs, in particular, for gap fraction distributions of the middle ranges of zenith angles (20 degrees-70 degrees). Moreover, simulation of the gap fraction for this middle portion of the zenith angle was insensitive to exact mapping of the stand. The hierarchical data acquisition approach, involving mapping of tree locations and tree reconstruction, permits realistic representation of canopy material distribution. Our approach and our comprehensive data set provide a solid basis from which to integrate data gathered at the stand and tree scales, and a powerful tool for the simulation of the light regime anywhere in the canopy.},

It simulates all non radiative energy mechanisms (heat conduction, turbulent momentum and heat fluxes, water reservoir evolution, etc.). It uses DART model (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) for simulating radiative mechanisms: 3D radiative budget of 3D scenes and their remote sensing images expressed in terms of reflectance or brightness temperature values, for any atmosphere, wavelength, sun/view direction, altitude and spatial resolution. It uses an innovative multispectral approach (ray tracing, exact kernel, discrete ordinate techniques) over the whole optical domain. This paper presents two major and recent improvements of DART for adapting it to urban canopies. (1) Simulation of the geometry and optical characteristics of urban elements (houses, etc.). (2) Modeling of thermal infrared emission by vegetation and urban elements. The new DART version was used in the context of the CAPITOUL project. For that, districts of the Toulouse urban data base (Autocad format) were translated into DART scenes. This allowed us to simulate visible, near infrared and thermal infrared satellite images of Toulouse districts. Moreover, the 3D radiation budget was used by DARTEB for simulating the time evolution of a number of geophysical quantities of various surface elements (roads, walls, roofs). Results were successfully compared with ground measurements of the CAPITOUL project.},

However, the majority of world forests occur in heterogeneous ecosystems and topography with rather complex canopy architecture. To improve the estimates of canopy structures and solar radiation regimes, a non-random spatial distribution parameter called clumping index (CI) has been used. We compared varying methodologies of CI determination on real HP acquired in contrasting forest types growing on sloping ground, and on simulated HP representing different aggregation levels of foliage elements. The major aim was the comparative analysis of the effects of forest types, forest density, slope and gap fraction acquisition accuracy on estimation of CI using the five different approaches. The result indicated that CI estimates based on gap size distribution approaches performed the best and were less affected by topography and forest density compared to approaches based on solely logarithmic gap averaging techniques.},

abstract = {The atmosphere strongly affects satellite measurements of Earth surfaces in the optical domain. Modeling this influence is complex. This is typically the case of the "Earth-Atmosphere" radiative coupling in the presence of Earth surfaces with spatially variable optical properties. In that case, it may be very difficult to couple Earth and cloud-free atmosphere radiative transfer models. This explains why an atmosphere module was input into the Earth radiative transfer (R.T.) model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) in order to simulate accurately satellite images of natural and urban Earth surfaces. This paper presents how DART simulates the atmosphere R.T. in the short wave and thermal infrared domains. The atmosphere is divided into 3 zones: bottom atmosphere (BA), mid atmosphere (MA) and high atmosphere (HA). The 3D distribution is arbitrary in BA and horizontally constant with any vertical distribution in MA and HA. The "Earth-Atmosphere" R.T. is modeled in 5 stages. 1) Atmosphere R.T. (i.e., atmosphere thermal emission and/or sun radiation scattering). 2) Earth surface R.T. (i.e., Earth thermal emission and/or atmosphere and direct sun radiation scattering). 3) Atmosphere R.T. (i.e., Earth radiation scattering). 4) Earth surface R.T. (i.e., scattering of downward atmosphere radiation). 5) Simulation of satellite reflectance and/or brightness temperature images. The approach takes into account the earth curvature and the atmosphere non-Beer law behavior in the presence of strongly varying spectral properties. It uses optimally located scattering points for improving atmosphere R.T. accuracy, and it reduces computer time through the use of pre-computed transfer functions that transfer radiation between the different atmosphere levels (BA, MA, HA). Moreover, it can simulate automatically an atmosphere geometry that optimizes the trade-off "Computer time-Accuracy" of simulations. The robustness and accuracy of the DART atmosphere modeling were successfully validated with theoretical cases and with the MODTRAN atmosphere R.T. model. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Human and natural forces are rapidly modifying the global distribution and structure of terrestrial ecosystems on which all of life depends, altering the global carbon cycle, affecting our climate now and for the foreseeable future, causing steep reductions in species diversity, and endangering Earth's sustainability.To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (Light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064. nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that:. (1)Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates.(2)The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30m along-transect measurements globally at 25m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization.We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The even-aged northern hardwood forests of the Upper Great Lakes Region are undergoing an ecological transition during which structural and biotic complexity is increasing. Early-successional aspen (Populus spp.) and birch (Betula papyrifera) are senescing at an accelerating rate and are being replaced by middle-successional species including northern red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), and white pine (Pinus strobus). Canopy structural complexity may increase due to forest age, canopy disturbances, and changing species diversity. More structurally complex canopies may enhance carbon (C) sequestration in old forests. We hypothesize that these biotic and structural alterations will result in increased structural complexity of the maturing canopy with implications for forest C uptake. At the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS), we combined a decade of observations of net primary productivity (NPP), leaf area index (LAI), site index, canopy tree-species diversity, and stand age with canopy structure measurements made with portable canopy lidar (PCL) in 30 forested plots. We then evaluated the relative impact of stand characteristics on productivity through succession using data collected over a nine-year period. We found that effects of canopy structural complexity on wood NPP (NPPw) were similar in magnitude to the effects of total leaf area and site quality. Furthermore, our results suggest that the effect of stand age on NPPw is mediated primarily through its effect on canopy structural complexity. Stand-level diversity of canopy-tree species was not significantly related to either canopy structure or NPPw. We conclude that increasing canopy structural complexity provides a mechanism for the potential maintenance of productivity in aging forests.},

abstract = {Canopy structure affects forest function by determining light availability and distribution. Many forests throughout the upper Great Lakes region are dominated by mature, even-aged, early successional aspen and birch, which comprise 35{\%}–40{\%} of canopy leaf area, and which are senescing at accelerating rates. In 2008 at the University of Michigan Biological Station, we initiated the Forest Accelerated Succession ExperimenT (FASET) by stem girdling all aspen and birch in replicated stands to induce mortality. Our objective was to understand type and rate of canopy structural changes imposed by rapid but diffuse disturbance consisting of mortality of a single age-species cohort. We characterized changes in canopy structural features in 2008–2011 using ground-based Portable Canopy Lidar (PCL) in paired treated and control stands. As aspen and birch in treated plots died, gap fraction of the upper canopy increased, average leaf height decreased, total canopy height declined, and openness of the whole-canopy increased. All of these trends became more pronounced with time. Our findings suggest that as forests throughout the region pass through the impending successional transition prompted by widespread mortality of canopy-dominant early successional aspen and birch species, the canopy will undergo significant structural reorganization with consequences for forest carbon assimilation.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to predict spatial distributions of snow properties important to the hydrology and the remote sensing signatures of the boreal ecosystem. This study is part of the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) of central Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba. Forested environments provide unique problems for snow cover process modeling due to the complex interactions among snow, energy transfer, and trees. These problems are approached by coupling a modified snow process model with a model of radiative interactions with forest canopies. Additionally, a tree well model describes the influence of individual trees on snow distribution on the ground. The snow process and energy budget model calculates energy exchange at the snow surface, in-pack snow processes, melting and liquid water flow, heat conduction, and vapor diffusion. The surface radiation model provides input on the radiation receipt at the snow surface for model runs in the jack pine forest. Field data consisted of measured meteorological parameters above and within the canopy, spatial variability of snow properties, and variations of incoming solar irradiance beneath the forest canopy. Results show that the area beneath tree canopies accumulated 60{\%} of the snow accumulated in forest openings. Peak solar irradiance on the snow cover was less than one half that measured above the canopy. Model runs are compared between the open and the forested sites and show the open area ablating four days before areas beneath the canopy and eight days before forest openings and compare favorably with measured data. Physically based modeling of snow ablation was successful at the forested site and nearby open area.},

abstract = {We present CanSPART: a model of gap probability (P gap) based on a simple but flexible geometric vegetation canopy structure, coupled to a one-dimensional radiative transfer scheme, to account for the effects of crown structure and trunks on vertically resolved canopy radiation fluxes. The P gap component of the model is intended for use in inverting ground-based and airborne gap-frequency data for biometric variables, while the full CanSPART model is intended for application within a one-dimensional multilayer soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer model. Our approach to modelling P gap is novel because it uses an analytic approximation to the crown porosity, which makes it computationally efficient. Further, it can accommodate any distribution of crown and trunk heights and dimensions, allowing the model to be applied to complex canopy structures with multiple layers. The P gap model is readily rewritten in terms of a clumping factor as a function of height and angle. Simulations of P gap($\theta$,z) for idealised canopies compared favourably with those of two other models: the Analytical Clumped Two-Stream (ACTS) model (Ni-Meister et al., 2010) and an adaptation of the Nilson (1999) model. We test the analytic approximation to the crown porosity, also inherent in the Nilson (1999) model, and the applicability of a single clumping factor without angle nor height dependence. Both simplifications are demonstrated to be valid. Lovell et al. (2012, this issue) provide quantitative assessment of the P gap component of CanSPART against ground-based lidar measurements from sites spanning a range of canopy structures.The radiative-transfer part of the model is an extension of the two-stream scheme, using P gap as input and requiring the solution of a single matrix equation. In contrast to existing modified two-stream models which use a clumping factor, we account for both the primary effect of clumping (enhanced uncollided flux intensities) and the secondary effect (enhanced interception of scattered radiation). Application of CanSPART to three contrasting Australian field sites show that P gap, the absorption of radiation by leaves, Q leaf, and albedo are sensitive to the clumping of leaves into crowns. Except for the most sparsely vegetated site, albedo predictions were significantly too high, unless both primary and secondary effects of clumping were included. This highlights the importance of accounting for the enhanced interception of radiation scattered by leaves in a clump (relative to the unclumped case) and suggests why modified two-stream canopy radiative transfer models using a clumping factor approach may systematically underestimate Q leaf and overestimate albedo. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Clumping index (CI), quantifying the level of foliage grouping within distinct canopy structures relative to a random distribution, is a key structural parameter of plant canopies and very useful in ecological and meteorological models. Previously, a Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index has been proposed to accurately retrieve the global CI using POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) data at {\~{}}6km resolution (Chen et al., 2005). In this study, we show for the first time a global CI map at 500m resolution derived using the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which currently provides the finest pseudo multi-angular data for the global land surface. In computing the NDHD we found that the hotspot calculated from the MODIS BRDF product is underestimated in comparison with POLDER measurements very near the hotspot. Without correcting the bias in MODIS data, the MODIS-derived CI could be overestimated. We have developed an approach to correct the MODIS hotspot magnitude with co-registered POLDER-3 data acquired at about the same time. Field-measured element-CIs in zenith angles of 30-60?? by the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies (TRAC) instrument from 38 sites together with corresponding needle-to-shoot area ratios were used to evaluate the performance of hotspot-corrected NDHD and to tune the parameters to get accurate CI. It is found that the MODIS-derived CI has a dependence on the solar zenith angle, and this dependence in the red band is smaller than that in the near infrared (NIR) band. The highest correlation between field measurements and MODIS-derived CI is achieved when hotspot at nadir is used. The correct estimation of forest species (and therefore the crown shapes) from land cover is very important to the accuracy of MODIS-derived CI. For the red band, the coefficient of determination (R 
                        2) between MODIS-derived CI and field-measured CI is 0.76 for all sites and R 
                        2 is 0.53 for only the needle-leaved forest sites after the hotspot correction, indicating that a strong correlation between MODIS-derived NDHD and CI indeed exists. The MODIS-derived CI is regularly smaller than the field measurement. The red band in the MODIS BRDF product is found to be better than the NIR band for deriving CI for the vegetation covers investigated (mostly dense forests). Therefore a global clumping index map has been produced using the corrected MODIS hot$\backslash$spot in the red band and optimized parameters. However there were 10 broad-leaved forest sites used in the validation, which are too few for a reliable validation. For the broad-leaved forest area, where the same crown shape (ellipsoid) is used in the algorithm, the global CI spatial pattern is interestingly very similar to the pattern of the land cover distribution, suggesting that the MODIS-derived map has effectively captured the structural differences among cover types. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Because there is no simple device capable of measuring the dry deposition rates of small particles and trace gases directly, much current activity is focused on the use of an inferential technique. In this method, measurements of atmospheric concentration (C) of selected chemical species are coupled with evaluations of appropriate deposition velocity (Vd) to yield estimates of dry deposition rate from their product. Difficulties arise concerning the ability to measure C, and especially regarding the poor knowledge of Vd for many species. A multiple resistance routine for deriving deposition velocities is presented here. Current knowledge of biological processes is incorporated into a first-generation lsbig leaf’ model; formulations of resistances appropriate for describing individual leaves are combined to simulate the canopy as a whole. The canopy resistance is combined with estimates of aerodynamic and boundary-layer resistances to approximate the total resistance to transfer, from which deposition velocity is then computed. Special emphasis is given to the influence of the diurnal cycle, to the way in which the various transfer resistances can be inferred from routine data, and to the role of canopy factors (e.g., leaf area index, wetness, temperature response, and sunshade fractions).},

abstract = {The global savanna biome is characterized by enormous diversity in the physiognomy and spatial structure of the vegetation. The foliage clumping index can be calculated from bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. It measures the response of the darkspot reflectance to increased shadow associated with clumped vegetation and is related to leaf area index. Clumping index theoretically declines with increasing woody cover until the tree canopy begins to become uniform. In this study, clumping index is calculated for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer BRDF data for the Australian tropical savanna, the tropical savannas of South America, and the tropical savannas of east, west and southern Africa and compared with site-based measurements of tree canopy cover, and with area-based classifications of land cover. There were differences in sensitivity of clumping index between red and near-infrared reflectance channels, and between savanna systems with markedly different woody vegetation physiognomy. Clumping index was broadly related to foliage cover from historical site data in Australia and in West Africa and Kenya, but not in Southern Africa nor with detailed site-based demographic data in the cerrado of Brazil. However, clumping index decreased with proportion of woody cover in land cover datasets for east Africa, Australia and the Colombian Llanos. There was overlap in the range of clumping index values for forest, cerrado and campo land covers in Brazil. Clumping index was generally negatively correlated with percentage tree cover from the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product, but regional differences in the relationship were evident. There were large differences in the frequency distributions of clumping index from savanna, woody savanna and grassland land cover classes between global ecoregions. The clumping index shows differing sensitivity to savanna woody cover for red and NIR reflectance, and requires regional calibration for application as a universal indicator. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The concept of canopy spectral invariants expresses the observation that simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy spectral transmittance and reflectance become wavelength independent and determine a small set of canopy structure specific variables. This set includes the canopy interceptance, the recollision and the escape probabilities. These variables specify an accurate relationship between the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to the incident solar radiation at the leaf and the canopy scale and allow for a simple and accurate parameterization for the partitioning of the incoming radiation into canopy transmission, reflection and absorption at any wavelength in the solar spectrum. This paper presents a solid theoretical basis for spectral invariant relationships reported in literature with an emphasis on their accuracies in describing the shortwave radiative properties of the three-dimensional vegetation canopies. The analysis of data on leaf and canopy spectral transmittance and reflectance collected during the international field campaign in Flakaliden, Sweden, June 25-July 4, 2002 supports the proposed theory. The results presented here are essential to both modeling and remote sensing communities because they allow the separation of the structural and radiometric components of the measured/modeled signal. The canopy spectral invariants offer a simple and accurate parameterization for the shortwave radiation block in many global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. In remote sensing applications, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if the wavelength-independent variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to structural characteristics of the three-dimensional vegetation canopy. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Simulations with the Hadley Centre general circulation model (HadCM3), including carbon cycle model and forced by a 'business-as-usual' emissions scenario, predict a rapid loss of Amazonian rainforest from the middle of this century onwards. The robustness of this projection to both uncertainty in physical climate drivers and the formulation of the land surface scheme is investigated. We analyse how the modelled vegetation cover in Amazonia responds to (i) uncertainty in the parameters specified in the atmosphere component of HadCM3 and their associated influence on predicted surface climate. We then enhance the land surface description and (ii) implement a multilayer canopy light interception model and compare with the simple 'big-leaf' approach used in the original simulations. Finally, (iii) we investigate the effect of changing the method of simulating vegetation dynamics from an area-based model (TRIFFID) to a more complex size- and age-structured approximation of an individual-based model (ecosystem demography). We find that the loss of Amazonian rainforest is robust across the climate uncertainty explored by perturbed physics simulations covering a wide range of global climate sensitivity. The introduction of the refined light interception model leads to an increase in simulated gross plant carbon uptake for the present day, but, with altered respiration, the net effect is a decrease in net primary productivity. However, this does not significantly affect the carbon loss from vegetation and soil as a consequence of future simulated depletion in soil moisture; the Amazon forest is still lost. The introduction of the more sophisticated dynamic vegetation model reduces but does not halt the rate of forest dieback. The potential for human-induced climate change to trigger the loss of Amazon rainforest appears robust within the context of the uncertainties explored in this paper. Some further uncertainties should be explored, particularly with respect to the representation of rooting depth.},

The objective of the present study is to investigate the applicability of three widely used techniques to three computer models having large uncertainties and varying degrees of complexity in order to highlight some of the problem areas that must be addressed in actual applications. The following approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are considered: (1) response surface methodology based on input determined from a fractional factorial design; (2) Latin hypercube sampling with and without regression analysis; and (3) differential analysis. These techniques are investigated with respect to (1) ease of implementation, (2) flexibility, (3) estimation of the cumulative distribution function of the output, and (4) adaptability to different methods of sensitivity analysis. With respect to these criteria, the technique using Latin hypercube sampling and regression analysis had the best overall performance. The models used in the investigation are well documented, thus making it possible for researchers to make comparisons of other techniques with the results in this study.},

abstract = {The concept of light-use efficiency (LUE) is the underlying basis for estimating carbon exchange in many ecosystem models, especially those models that utilize remote sensing to constrain estimates of canopy photosynthesis. An understanding of the factors that control the efficiency with which forest canopies harvest available light to fix carbon via photosynthesis is therefore necessary for the development of useful production efficiency models. We present an analysis of observations of daily LUE for 2004 in a northern hardwood stand at the Bartlett Experimental Forest CO2 flux tower, White Mountains, New Hampshire (USA). We used eddy covariance measurements to estimate gross carbon exchange (GCE), and radiometric instruments mounted above and below the canopy to estimate the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (fAPAR). Both GCE and fAPAR show strong seasonal and day-to-day variability that contribute to temporal variation in LUE. During the middle of the growing season, when fAPAR is relatively constant, day-to-day variation in LUE is largely explained (r2 = 0.85) by changes in the ratio of diffuse to total downwelling radiation, but is not strongly correlated with any other measured meteorological variable. We also calculated top-of-canopy NDVI based on measurements of reflected radiation at 400-700 and 305-2800 nm. Seasonal variation in this broadband NDVI paralleled that of the 500 m MODIS pixel containing the flux tower. The relationship between broadband NDVI and fAPAR is approximately linear during green-up, but non-linear during autumn senescence. This seasonal hysteresis has implications for the use of remote sensing indices (such as NDVI or EVI) in satellite estimation of fAPAR for production efficiency modeling. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reviews current knowledge concerning the use of direct and indirect methods for LAI determination. The value of optical LAI measurements by means of hemispherical photography has already been demonstrated in previous studies. As clumping seems to be the main factor causing errors in indirect LAI estimation, we suggest that the use of a digital camera with high dynamic range has the potential to overcome a number of described technical problems related to indirect LAI estimation.

abstract = {Terrestrial plant productivity tends to increase under increasing but non-saturating photosynthetically active solar radiation when water, temperature and nutrients are not limiting. However, studies have shown that photosynthesis can also be higher under enhanced diffuse light despite a decrease in total irradiance. Clouds and atmospheric aerosols are two important variables that determine the total and proportion of diffuse light reaching the surface and thereby the rate of photosynthesis and carbon accumulation in plants. In addition to these factors, the response of plants to diffuse radiation is also dependant on plant characteristics such as functional types, leaf physiology, leaf area, leaf inclination, canopy structure and shape (i.e. clumping). Local environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, soil moisture, vapour pressure deficit, etc.) then modulate these plant responses. Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of clouds and aerosols thus can modify the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the role of solar radiation in terrestrial carbon processes has become one of the goals in terrestrial carbon cycle studies. It can help to identify the control and mechanisms of carbon processes and determines the geographical and temporal distribution of the major pools and fluxes in the global carbon cycle. Here we review the role of clouds and aerosols in partitioning solar radiation and their interactions with carbon processes of terrestrial plants. We also focus our review on vegetation characteristics that control the impact of radiation partitioning on vegetation carbon processes and the role of modelling approach to study this impact. We identify gaps in this field of research and further propose recommendations to bridge the gap.},

abstract = {The Large-scale Biosphere–Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) is a multinational, interdisciplinary research program led by Brazil. Ecological studies in LBA focus on how tropical forest conversion, regrowth, and selective logging influence carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable land use in the Amazon region. Early results from ecological studies within LBA emphasize the var- iability within the vast Amazon region and the profound effects that land-use and land- cover changes are having on that landscape. The predominant land cover of the Amazon region is evergreen forest; nonetheless, LBA studies have observed strong seasonal patterns in gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange, as well as phenology and tree growth. The seasonal patterns vary spatially and interannually and evidence suggests that these patterns are driven not only by variations in weather but also by innate biological rhythms of the forest species. Rapid rates of deforestation have marked the forests of the Amazon region over the past three decades. Evidence from ground-based surveys and remote sensing show that substantial areas of forest are being degraded by logging activities and through the collapse of forest edges. Because forest edges and logged forests are susceptible to fire, positive feedback cycles of forest degradationmay be initiated by land-use-change events. LBA studies indicate that cleared lands in the Amazon, once released from cultivation or pasture usage, regenerate biomass rapidly. However, the pace of biomass accumulation is dependent upon past land use and the depletion of nutrients by unsustainable land-management practices. The challenge for ongoing research within LBA is to integrate the recognition of diverse patterns and processes into general models for prediction of regional ecosystem function.},

Data were obtained from field measurements, restricted to periods with plentiful soil water, adequate light, high relative humidity and moderate temperature. The data encompass most major vegetation types and a wide range of leaf area index (Lambda). Observed G(smax) is not systematically dependent on Lambda; and takes average values of 20 and 33 mm s(-1) for natural vegetation and agricultural crops. A similar pattern exists in the g(smax) data, which yield remarkably consistent average values of 6 and 12 mm s(-1), respectively, for natural vegetation and crops. Overall, the ratio G(smax)/g(smax) is consistently close to 3, for seven major vegetation types of diverse structure. A simple model accounts for the close relationship between g(smax) and G(smax), and in particular how G(smax) is conservative against Lambda because of the compensating decrease in plant canopy evaporation and increase in soil evaporation as Lambda diminishes. The results are important for development of parameters for biosphere-atmosphere interactions in models. [References: 47] 47},

abstract = {Radiative transfer models for vegetation serve as a basis for extracting vegetation variables using directional/spectral data from modern-borne sensors (e.g., MODIS, MISR, POLDER, SeaWiFS). Only recently have significant efforts been made to provide operational algorithms to invert these models. These efforts have exposed a need to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of traditional methods for inverting these physically based models. In an effort to overcome the limitations of traditional inversion methods, a neural network method was designed and tested. In this study, a complex 3D model (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer, DART) was inverted for a wide range of simulated forest canopies using POLDER-like data. The model was inverted to recover three forest canopy variables: forest cover, leaf area index, and a soil reflectance parameter. The ranges of these variables were 0.4-1.0, 0.8-9.3, and 0.0-1.0, respectively. Two inversion methods were used - a traditional inversion technique using a modified simplex method, and a neural network method in combination with an exhaustive variable selection technique. A comparison of the methods' efficiency, accuracy, and stability was made. The neural network method gave relatively accurate solutions to the inversion problem given a small subset of directional/spectral data using only one to five view angles. Using only nadir data, the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the forest cover, leaf area index, and the soil reflectance parameter were 0.025, 0.23, and 0.15, respectively, and using the "best" view directions (2-5) were 0.021, 0.21, and 0.11, respectively. In general, the neural network method was more accurate than the simplex method. The results from both methods showed that the addition of directional view angles, as opposed to only a nadir view, can significantly improve the accuracy of recovering forest canopy characteristics. The traditional simplex method is computationally intensive and may not be appropriate for many operational applications on a per-pixel basis for regional and global data. The neural network method was computationally efficient and can be applied on a per-pixel basis. In general, the neural network technique had significantly lower RMSE values at the low noise levels. However, at moderate noise levels, the simplex method was equal to the neural network method in RMSE values. At high noise levels, the simplex method had significantly lower RMSE values than the neural network method. The neural network approach can provide an accurate, efficient, and stable inversion method for radiative transfer models using directional/spectral data from modern-borne sensors. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

They are sensitive to important structural features of the canopy such as forest cover, tree density, leaf area index, crown geometry, forest type and stand age. This paper presents the mathematical basis of the concept which is linked to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the three-dimensional radiative transfer equation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most land surface and ecosystem models assume that a vegetated canopy can be abstracted as a turbid medium when such models compute mass, energy, and carbon exchange. However, those models fail to simulate radiation environments in heterogeneous landscapes. This study aims to couple a spatially explicit three-dimensional (3D) shortwave and longwave radiative transfer model with a soil and canopy energy balance and canopy physiology model (CANOAK-FLiES), to investigate how well the 3D model performs in a heterogeneous landscape compared to a 1D model. The canopy structural parameters were extracted using airborne-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and digital cover photographs. The developed model was compared with a wide variety of field and remote sensing data (e.g., hyper-spectral remote sensing images, overstory and understory radiation, and tower-based energy and CO2 fluxes) in a woody oak savanna in CA, USA. Overall, the simulated spatial and diurnal patterns of the radiation environment were consistent with the measurements of shortwave and longwave wavebands. The 3D approach worked better than the 1D approach from the wet mild spring to the dry hot summer while the relative importance of using the 3D approach depends on climate and canopy physiological conditions as well as the canopy structure. With low leaf area index in the oak woodland, the woody elements absorbed 12{\%}-39{\%} of the PAR and 20{\%}-52{\%} of the NIR radiation. Consequently, 12{\%} of the daytime energy flux was used as woody heat storage at our study site. This novel 3D model has the potential to serve as a useful tool for analyzing the spatio-temporal variability of radiation and energy fluxes in evaluating footprints of radiation sensors and eddy covariance fluxes, and serve as a standard in evaluating the performance of a hierarchy of simpler land surface models to compute mass and energy exchange of heterogeneous landscapes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge of light interactions between the atmosphere and vegetation, and within vegetation are of particular interest for terrestrial carbon cycle studies and optical remote sensing. This study describes a model for 3-D canopy radiative transfer that is directly coupled with an atmospheric radiative transfer model (Forest Light Environmental Simulator, FLiES). The model was developed based on the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method using some existing modeling frameworks. To integrate the canopy radiative transfer model with atmosphere, the same numerical method, sampling technique, and variance reduction technique were employed in both the atmospheric and the canopy modules. Farquhar's leaf photosynthesis model was combined to calculate the canopy level photosynthesis from the light environmental parameters obtained by the radiative transfer calculation. In order to document the quality of the coupled model, we first compared the atmospheric radiative transfer module to well known 1-D atmospheric radiative transfer models, and then evaluated the 3-D canopy radiative transfer module against a series of test cases provided by the RAMI On-line Model Checker (ROMC). We used the model to show the impact of atmospheric properties and 3-D canopy structure on the directionality of downward photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the top of canopy, the 3-D distribution of absorbed PAR (APAR), and overall canopy photosynthesis. The results indicate the importance to consider angular geometry of incident light at TOC and 3-D canopy structure. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new method for measuring plant canopy nonrandomness and other architectural components has been developed using a 16 bit (65535 gray scale levels) charged-coupled device (CCD) camera that captures images of plant canopies in two wavelength bands. This complete system is referred to as a multiband vegetation imager (MVI). The use of two wavelength bands (visible (VIS) 400{\&}{\#}8211;620 nm and near infrared (NIR) 720{\&}{\#}8211;950 nm) permits identification of sunlit and shaded foliage, sunlit and shaded branch area, clouds, and blue sky based on the camera's resolution, and the varying spectral properties that scene components have in the two wavelength bands. This approach is different from other canopy imaging methods (such as fish-eye photography) because it emphasizes measuring the fraction of an image occupied by various scene components (branches, shaded leaves, sunlit leaves) under different sky conditions rather than simply the canopy gap fraction under uniform sky conditions. The MVI has been used during the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) in aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) to estimate architectural characteristics of each canopy. The leaf area index (LAI), sunlit LAI, and degree of nonrandomness within a canopy are architectural properties that have been measured with the MVI. Using a crown-based Monte Carlo model for nonrandom canopies, nonrandomness factors are calculated from MVI data using two approaches (gap fraction and gap-size distribution theories) to correct total and sunlit LAI estimates from indirect methods that assume random foliage distributions. Canopy nonrandomness factors obtained from analyzing the gap-size distribution in a Monte Carlo model are shown to be a function of path length (angle) through the canopy ({\&}{\#}937; e ({\&}{\#}952;)); thus we suggest that LAI-2000 indirect measurements of LAI be adjusted with the value of {\&}{\#}937; e ({\&}{\#}952;) at {\&}{\#}952; = 35° because this is the mean angle at which the canopy gap fraction is measured by the LAI-2000. In this study, values of {\&}{\#}937; e (35) = 0.69 in an aspen forest. Alternatively, corrections to indirect LAI measurements obtained with the MVI in this study are made using the value of {\&}{\#}937; e (0) because the MVI is used to measure the canopy gap-size distribution and gap fraction within 15° of the zenith. Values of {\&}{\#}937; e (0) obtained with the MVI in aspen are typically between 0.55 and 0.65; while in balsam poplar, average values of {\&}{\#}937; e (0) are equal to 0.82. This study shows that the MVI provides an attractive indirect measurement technique to obtain accurate estimates of total LAI in aspen. Corrected canopy LAI and direct LAI measurements are greater than indirect estimates based on assuming the foliage to be randomly distributed: In aspen, total LAI is 45{\%} larger (3.3 versus 2.0) and sunlit LAI (40° Sun zenith angle) 10{\%} larger, while in balsam poplar, total LAI is 17{\%} larger (2.3 versus 1.9) and sunlit LAI is only 1{\%} larger. The importance of these clumping characteristics is best appreciated with estimates of canopy net CO2 assimilation derived from scaling leaf photosynthesis versus light relations. Aspen canopy assimilation accounting for clumping is 39{\%} larger than estimates based on indirect measurements of total LAI and the assumption that foliage is randomly distributed.},

abstract = {We used field measurements and Monte Carlo simulations of canopy gap-size distribution and gap fraction to examine how beam radiation interacts with clumped boreal forest canopies of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx,), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.). We demonstrate that the Beer-Lambert law can be modified to accommodate transmission of radiation through a clumped forest canopy as a function of path length or sun zenith angle. Multiband Vegetation Imager (MVI) measurements and Monte Carlo simulations showed that values of the zenith element clumping index (Omega(e)(0)) are typically between 0.4 and 0.5 in jack pine and black spruce and 0.65 in aspen. Estimates of LAI obtained from MVI measurements of the canopy gap fraction and adjusted for canopy clumping and branch architecture yielded LAI values of 3.0 in jack pine, 3.3 in aspen, and about 6.0 in black spruce. These LAI estimates were within 10-25{\%} of direct measurements made at the same sites. Data obtained with the MVI, along with numerical simulations, demonstrated that assumptions of random foliage distributions in boreal forests are invalid and could yield erroneous values of LAI measured by indirect techniques and false characterizations of atmosphere-biosphere interactions. Monte Carlo simulations were used to develop a general equation for beam radiation penetration as a function of zenith angle in clumped canopies, The essential measurements included stem spacing, crown diameter, crown depth, and within-crown gap fraction.},

abstract = {A method for calculating the light extinction probability caused by a forest canopy is presented. With the calculation procedure, it is possible to examine the effect of crown shape, stand density and spatial distribution of trees on the spatial distribution of light extinction probability or on the total shaded area caused by the canopy. At low sun elevations, the momentary projection area of a single crown is greater the more vertically extended the crown is, if the crown volume is held constant. When a longer time period is concerned, the area where the average extinction probability exceeds some arbitrary value is greatest for umbrella-like, horizontally extended crowns. The same is true for a single tree and for a forest stand. When the stand density is low or the tree crown is narrow, the spatial distribution of trees has only a small effect on the amount of shaping; the total amount of shading in random distribution is almost the same as in systematic distribution. In a stand where the total horizontal projection area of crown cones is high, the spatial distribution of trees should be systematic for effective light interception. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {The potential use of the information from a sampling of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) has suffered from the lack of solid applications in ecology, where it is expected to play the role of an advanced descriptor of vegetation as a complement to hyperspectral measurements. Such a shortcoming stems from the lack of consistent angular data sets with an adequate resolution at global scale. In this context, the POLDER instrument is particularly relevant because it acquires directional radiance signatures at a high angular resolution and thereby provides the first global BRDF product. In this paper, we investigate how to discriminate vegetation types in using only a portion of the BRDF, in particular, the two paramount directional signatures, which are the maximum (hot spot) and the minimum (dark spot) of reflectance observed in the backscattering and forward scattering regions, respectively. A directional index hot-dark spot (HDS) is formulated using these two signatures. It is defined as the normalized difference between the reflectances at the hot spot and dark spot. It is shown that the HDS can be linearly related with the foliage clumping index for three different vegetation types observed by the spaceborne POLDER sensor. The significance of the clumping index mapping for ecological studies is evaluated using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). Considering foliage clumping in BEPS, the estimation of daily canopy photosynthesis can differ about 20{\%} for a black spruce site. In this context, it is expected that the findings of this study will have a strong impact on the use of directional optical remote sensing to improve the assessment of terrestrial productivity and carbon cycle. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Leaf area and its spatial distribution are key canopy parameters needed to model the radiation regime within a forest and to compute the mass and energy exchange between a forest and the atmosphere. A much larger proportion of available net radiation is received at the forest floor in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. The proportion of ecosystem water vapor exchange (lambda E) and sensible heat exchange from the forest floor is therefore expected to be larger in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. We used a combination of optical and canopy geometry measurements, and robust one- and three-dimensional models to evaluate the influence of canopy architecture and radiative transfer on estimates of carbon, water and energy exchange of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forest. Three-dimensional model simulations showed that the average probability of diffuse and direct radiation transmittance to the forest floor was greater than if a random distribution of foliage had been assumed. Direct and diffuse radiation transmittance to the forest floor was 28 and 39{\%}, respectively, in the three-dimensional model simulations versus 23 and 31{\%}, respectively, in the one-dimensional model simulations. The assumption of randomly distributed foliage versus inclusion of clumping factors in a one-dimensional, multi-layer biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange model (CANVEG) had the greatest effect on simulated annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil evaporation. Assuming random distribution, NEE was 41{\%} lower, net photosynthesis 3{\%} lower, total lambda E 10{\%} lower, and soil evaporation 40{\%} lower. The same comparisons at LAI 5 showed a similar effect on annual NEE estimates (37{\%}) and lambda E (12{\%}), but a much larger effect on net photosynthesis (20{\%}), suggesting that, at low LAI, canopies are mostly sunlit, so that redistribution of light has little effect on net photosynthesis, whereas the effect on net photosynthesis is much greater at high LAIs.},

abstract = {We compared carbon storage and fluxes in young and old ponderosa pine stands in Oregon, including plant and soil storage, net primary productivity, respiration fluxes, eddy flux estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and Biome-BGC simulations of fluxes. The young forest (Y site) was previously an old-growth ponderosa pine forest that had been clearcut in 1978, and the old forest (O site), which has never been logged, consists of two primary age classes (50 and 250 years old). Total ecosystem carbon content (vegetation, detritus and soil) of the O forest was about twice that of the Y site (21 vs. 10 kg C m(-2) ground), and significantly more of the total is stored in living vegetation at the O site (61{\%} vs. 15{\%}). Ecosystem respiration (R-e) was higher at the O site (1014 vs. 835 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and it was largely from soils at both sites (77{\%} of R-e). The biological data show that above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), NPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) were greater at the O site than the Y site. Monte Carlo estimates of NEP show that the young site is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, and is significantly lower than NEP(O) by c. 100 g C m(-2) year(-1). Eddy covariance measurements also show that the O site was a stronger sink for CO2 than the Y site. Across a 15-km swath in the region, ANPP ranged from 76 g C m(-2) year(-1) at the Y site to 236 g C m(-2) year(-1) (overall mean 158 +/- 14 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The lowest ANPP values were for the youngest and oldest stands, but there was a large range of ANPP for mature stands. Carbon, water and nitrogen cycle simulations with the Biome-BGC model suggest that disturbance type and frequency, time since disturbance, age-dependent changes in below-ground allocation, and increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 all exert significant control on the net ecosystem exchange of carbon at the two sites. Model estimates of major carbon flux components agree with budget-based observations to within +/-20{\%}, with larger differences for NEP and for several storage terms. Simulations showed the period of regrowth required to replace carbon lost during and after a stand-replacing fire (O) or a clearcut (Y) to be between 50 and 100 years. In both cases, simulations showed a shift from net carbon source to net sink (on an annual basis) 10-20 years after disturbance. These results suggest that the net ecosystem production of young stands may be low because heterotrophic respiration, particularly from soils, is higher than the NPP of the regrowth. The amount of carbon stored in long-term pools (biomass and soils) in addition to short-term fluxes has important implications for management of forests in the Pacific North-west for carbon sequestration.},

We discuss changes compared to previous estimates consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement production (EFF) are based on energy statistics, while emissions from Land-Use Change (ELUC), including deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover change data, fire activity in regions undergoing deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated for the first time in this budget with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. All uncertainties are reported as ± 1 sigma, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (2003–2012), EFF was 8.6 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, ELUC 0.8 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, GATM 4.3 ± 0.1 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN 2.6 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and SLAND 2.6 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1. For year 2012 alone, EFF grew to 9.7 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, 2.2{\%} above 2011, reflecting a continued trend in these emissions; GATM was 5.2 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and assuming and ELUC of 0.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (based on 2001–2010 average), SLAND was 2.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1. GATM was high in 2012 compared to the 2003–2012 average, almost entirely reflecting the high EFF. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 392.52 ± 0.10 ppm on average over 2012. We estimate that EFF will increase by 2.1{\%} (1.1–3.1{\%}) to 9.9 ± 0.5 GtC in 2013, 61{\%} above emissions in 1990, based on projections of World Gross Domestic Product and recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy. With this projection, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach about 550 ± 60 GtC for 1870–2013, 70{\%} from EFF (390 ± 20 GtC) and 30{\%} from ELUC (160 ± 55 GtC).

Ten HPs were simulated in 75 scenes with random, erectophile and planophile leaf angle distributions. PAI retrieved using Beer's law near 57.3° (55-60°) and with the truncated Miller integration over zenith angles from 10° to 65° gave similar results. The importance of clumping was also shown to obtain accurate PAI. Foliage density inside the crown was a major factor causing underestimates of the PAI because the clumping effect was underestimated. Moreover, best PAI retrievals were found with the clumping index method using the Chen and Cihlar method combined with the Lang and Xiang method (relative RMSE of 23-24{\%} and relative median absolute error of 12-14{\%}) and was slightly less affected by the averaging length when compared with only using the Lang and Xiang. Previous error measurements of 29{\%} were reduced to 16-23{\%} for a black spruce stand using updated input variables and the method presented here, and they were shown to fall within the errors of the simulation framework. © 2014.},

An asymmetric hotspot, in which the shape of the hotspot is related to the shape of the plant crowns in the scene, is created. At large zenith angles illumination shadows will preferentially shadow the lower portions of adjacent crowns. Further, these shadows will be preferentially obscured since adjacent crowns will also tend to obscure the lower portions of other crowns. This effect produces a `bowl-shaped' bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) in which the scene brightness increases at the function's edges. Formulas describing the hotspot and mutual-shadowing effects are derived, and examples that show how the shape of the BRDF is dependent on the shape of the crowns, their density, their brightness relative to the background, and the thickness of the layer throughout which the crown centers are distributed are presented},

abstract = {A new model for the bidirectional reflectance of a vegetation
cover combines principles of geometric optics and radiative transfer. It
relies on gap probabilities and path length distributions to model the
penetration of irradiance from a parallel source and the single and
multiple scattering of that irradiance in the direction of an observer.
The model applies to vegetation covers of discrete plant crowns that are
randomly centered both on the plane and within a layer of variable
thickness above it. Crowns assume a spheroidal shape with arbitrary
height to width ratio. Geometric optics easily models the irradiance
that penetrates the vegetation cover directly, is scattered by the soil,
and exits without further scattering by the vegetation. Within a plant
crown, the probability of scattering is a negative exponential function
of path length. Within-crown scattering provides the source for
singly-scattered radiation, which exits with probabilities proportional
to further path-length distributions in the direction of exitance
(including the hotspot effect). Single scattering provides the source
for double scattering, and then higher order pairs of scattering are
solved successively by a convolution function. Early validations using
data from a conifer stand near Howland, Maine, show reasonable agreement
between modeled and observed reflectance},

abstract = {Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are an essential part of current state-of-the-art Earth system models. In recent years, the complexity of DGVMs has increased by incorporating new important processes like, e.g., nutrient cycling and land cover dynamics, while biogeophysical processes like surface radiation have not been developed much further. Canopy radiation models are however very important for the estimation of absorption and reflected fluxes and are essential for a proper estimation of surface carbon, energy and water fluxes. The present study provides an overview of current implementations of canopy radiation schemes in a couple of state-of-the-art DGVMs and assesses their accuracy in simulating canopy absorption and reflection for a variety of different surface conditions. Systematic deviations in surface albedo and fractions of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (faPAR) are identified and potential impacts are assessed. The results show clear deviations for both, absorbed and reflected, surface solar radiation fluxes. FaPAR is typically underestimated, which results in an underestimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) for the investigated cases. The deviation can be as large as 25{\%} in extreme cases. Deviations in surface albedo range between ĝ̂'0.15 ĝ‰Currency sign $\Delta$$\alpha$ĝ‰Currency sign 0.36, with a slight positive bias on the order of $\Delta$$\alpha$ĝ‰̂ 0.04. Potential radiative forcing caused by albedo deviations is estimated at ĝ̂'1.25 ĝ‰Currency sign RF ĝ‰Currency sign ĝ̂'0.8 (W mĝ̂'2), caused by neglect of the diurnal cycle of surface albedo. The present study is the first one that provides an assessment of canopy RT schemes in different currently used DGVMs together with an assessment of the potential impact of the identified deviations. The paper illustrates that there is a general need to improve the canopy radiation schemes in DGVMs and provides different perspectives for their improvement. © Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {A general theory is presented which describes the interaction between radiation and a spruce forest. The canopy is divided into a series of layers so that all the radiation fluxes can be computed if the layer interception, reflection, and transmission properties are known. The effects of multiple scattering at any wavelength and variable diffuse angular distribution are included. The layer properties are calculated either assuming the foliage to be randomly distributed and with or without stems and branches, or assuming the foliage to be clumped with non-random wood and leaf distributions which are derived from the actual canopy (shoots and whorls). The theory is extended to include an estimate of the gap-size distribution so that penumbral effects can be incorporated into the transmission distribution predictions. The results of the theory are compared to measurements made in a visible (0.51-0.57 $\mu$ m) and a near infra-red (0.73-1.0 $\mu$ m) waveband. The measurements were obtained by traversing a sensor along a 14 m scan path at four levels within the canopy. The best agreement between theory and measurements was obtained with the grouping theory which included stems and branches. On the average the random theory (without branches) agreed reasonably well with the measurements but predicted considerably more energy in the form of scattered radiation than beam when compared to the grouping theory. The grouping theory is more likely to be correct and the difference could be significant in predictions of photosynthesis. The ratio of visible to near infra-red canopy transmittance did not prove to be a good indicator of leaf area index because of the extreme importance of canopy structure, but the diffuse angular distribution may be a reasonable indicator since it is relatively insensitive to canopy structure, sun inclination angle, or the presence of branches. The calculated visible transmission distribution based on the grouping theory agreed well with the measurements. It is probable that the most important penumbral contribution for photosynthesis arises from gaps between needles on shoots. It should be noted that the predictions of this theory rely solely on canopy structural and spectral information and incident radiation above the canopy as inputs; no radiation measurements within the canopy are required.},

The model stratified the canopy of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest into six layers and estimated photosynthesis in each layer according to the Farquhar submodel coupled with the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance submodel. The model was parameterized with a suite of physiological measurements, including leaf area index (LAI), leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, photosynthesis-N relationships, and stomatal conductance. The model was Validated against measured leaf photosynthesis and canopy carbon (C) fluxes estimated from eddy-covariance measurements (ECM). Application of this model to simulate canopy C fixation from 28 August 1996, the onset of CO(2) fumigation, to 31 December 1998 suggested that elevation of atmospheric [CO(2)] to ambient + 200 muL/L resulted in increase of canopy C fixation by 35{\%} in 1996, 39{\%} in 1997, and 43{\%} in 1998. The modeled GPP and its response to elevated [CO(2)] were sensitive to parameter values of quantum yield of electron transport, leaf area index, and the vertical distribution of LAI within the canopy. Thus, further investigation on those parameters will help improve the precision of estimated ecosystem-scale C fluxes. Furthermore, comparison between the modeled and ECM-estimated canopy C fluxes suggested that soil moisture, in addition to air vapor pressure, controlled canopy photosynthesis during the drought period.},

The consequences for mankind of ongoing climate change will be far-reaching. Earth System Models are capable of replicating climate regimes of past millennia and are the best means we have of predicting the future of our climate. The basic ideas of numerical forecasting and climate modeling were developed about a century ago, long before the first electronic computer was constructed. There were several major practical obstacles to be overcome before numerical prediction could be put into practice. A fuller understanding of atmospheric dynamics allowed the development of simplified systems of equations; regular radiosonde observations of the free atmosphere and, later, satellite data, provided the initial conditions; stable finite difference schemes were developed; and powerful electronic computers provided a practical means of carrying out the prodigious calculations required to predict the changes in the weather. Progress in weather forecasting and in climate modeling over the past 50 years has been dramatic. In this presentation, we will trace the history of computer forecasting through the ENIAC integrations to the present day. The useful range of deterministic prediction is increasing by about one day each decade, and our understanding of climate change is growing rapidly as Earth System Models of ever-increasing sophistication are developed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We used such a high resolution to be able to parameterize DART in an appropriate way and subsequently to gain detailed understanding of the influence of woody elements contributing to the radiative transfer within heterogeneous canopies. Three scenarios were studied by modelling the Norway spruce canopy as being composed of i) leaves, ii) leaves, trunks and first order branches, and finally iii) leaves, trunks, first order branches and small woody twigs simulated using mixed cells (i.e. cells approximated as composition of leaves and/or twigs turbid medium, and large woody constituents). The simulation of each scenario was performed for 10 different canopy closures (CC = 50-95{\%}, in steps of 5{\%}), 25 leaf area index (LAI = 3.0-15.0 m2 m- 2, in steps of 0.5 m2 m- 2), and in four spectral bands (centred at 559, 671, 727, and 783 nm, with a FWHM of 10 nm). The influence of woody elements was evaluated separately for both, sunlit and shaded parts of the simulated forest canopy, respectively. The DART results were verified by quantifying the simulated nadir BRF of each scenario with measured Airborne Imaging Spectroradiometer (AISA) Eagle data (pixel size of 0.4 m). These imaging spectrometer data were acquired over the same Norway spruce stand that was used to parameterise the DART model. The Norway spruce canopy modelled using the DART model consisted of foliage as well as foliage including robust woody constituents (i.e. trunks and branches). All results showed similar nadir BRF for the simulated wavelengths. The incorporation of small woody parts in DART caused the canopy reflectance to decrease about 4{\%} in the near-infrared (NIR), 2{\%} in the red edge (RE) and less than 1{\%} in the green band. The canopy BRF of the red band increased by about 2{\%}. Subsequently, the sensitivity on accounting for woody elements for two spectral vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the angular vegetation index (AVI), was evaluated. Finally, we conclude on the importance of including woody elements in radiative transfer based approaches and discuss the applicability of the vegetation indices as well as the physically based inversion approaches to retrieve the forest canopy LAI at very high spatial resolution. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For large trees with variable amounts of live crown, estimates of leaf area based on tree diameter appear to be inaccurate; therefore, the exceedingly high leaf-area indices previously reported for Douglas-fir forests are unre- liable.

The HadGEM2 physical model includes improvements designed to address specific systematic errors encountered in the previous climate configuration, HadGEM1, namely Northern Hemisphere continental temperature biases and tropical sea surface temperature biases and poor variability. Targeting these biases was crucial in order that the ES configuration could represent important biogeochemical climate feedbacks. Detailed descriptions and evaluations of particular HadGEM2 family members are included in a number of other publications, and the discussion here is limited to a summary of the overall performance using a set of model metrics which compare the way in which the various configurations simulate present-day climate and its variability.},

abstract = {Two published models of canopy photosynthesis, MAESTRO and BIOMASS, are simulated to examine the response of tree stands to increasing ambient concentrations of carbon dioxide (C(a)) and temperatures. The models employ the same equations to described leaf gas exchange, but differ considerably in the level of detail employed to represent canopy structure and radiation environment. Daily rates of canopy photosynthesis simulated by the two models agree to within 10{\%} across a range of CO2 concentrations and temperatures. A doubling of C(a) leads to modest increases of simulated daily canopy photosynthesis at low temperatures (10{\%} increase at 10-degrees-C), but larger increases at higher temperatures (60{\%} increase at 30-degrees-C). The temperature and CO2 dependencies of canopy photosynthesis are interpreted in terms of simulated contributions by quantum-saturated and non-saturated foliage. Simulations are presented for periods ranging from a diurnal cycle to several years. Annual canopy photosynthesis simulated by BIOMASS for trees experiencing no water stress is linearly related to simulated annual absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, with light utilization coefficients for carbon of epsilon = 1.66 and 2.07 g MJ-1 derived for C(a) of 350 and 700 mumol mol-1, respectively.},

Time, cost, and precision constraints cause these programs to seek technological innovations that contribute to measurement and estimation efficiencies and that facilitate the production and distribution of an increasing array of inventory data, estimates, and derived products. Many of the recent innovations have involved remotely sensed data and related statistical estimation techniques. Current applications of remote sensing in support of national forest inventories are reviewed for three areas: (1) observation or measurement, meaning using remotely sensed data in lieu of field observations or measurements; (2) estimation, meaning calculation of traditional inventory areal estimates such as forest area or volume per unit area; and (3) mapping. Future applications focus on two areas: augmenting field measurements with remotely sensed data obtained from lidar sensors and Internet accessible map-based estimation. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {We tested the ability of a model to scale gas exchange from leaf level to whole-tree level by: (1) measuring leaf gas exchange in the canopy of 10 trees in a tall Eucalyptus delegatensis RT Baker forest in NSW, Australia; (2) monitoring sap flow of the same 10 trees during the measurement week; and (3) using an individual-tree-based model (MAESTRA) to link the two sets of measurements. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance components of the model were parameterized with the leaf gas exchange data, and canopy structure was parameterized with crown heights, dimensions and leaf areas of each of the measurement trees and up to 45 neighboring trees. Transpiration of the measurement trees was predicted by the model and compared with sap flow data. Leaf gas exchange parameters were similar for all 10 trees, with the exception of two smaller trees that had relatively low stomatal conductances. We hypothesize that these trees may have experienced water stress as a result of competition from large neighboring trees. The model performed well, and in most cases, was able to replicate the time course of tree transpiration. Maximum rates of transpiration were higher than measured rates for some trees and lower than measured rates for others, which may have been a result of inaccuracy in estimating tree leaf area. There was a small lag (about 15-30 minutes) between sap flow and modeled transpiration for some trees in the morning, likely associated with use of water stored in stems. The model also captured patterns of variation in sap flow among trees. Overall, the study confirms the ability of models to estimate forest canopy transpiration from leaf-level measurements.},

abstract = {Insights into how terrestrial ecosystems affect the Earth's response to changes in climate and rising atmospheric CO(2) levels rely heavily on the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). These models contain detailed mechanistic representations of biological processes affecting terrestrial ecosystems; however, their ability to simultaneously predict field-based measurements of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes has remained largely untested. In this study, we address this issue by developing a constrained implementation of a new structured TBM, the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), which explicitly tracks the dynamics of fine-scale ecosystem structure and function. Carbon and water flux measurements from an eddy-flux tower are used in conjunction with forest inventory measurements of tree growth and mortality at Harvard Forest (42.5 degrees N, 72.1 degrees W) to estimate a number of important but weakly constrained model parameters. Evaluation against a decade of tower flux and forest dynamics measurements shows that the constrained ED2 model yields greatly improved predictions of annual net ecosystem productivity, carbon partitioning, and growth and mortality dynamics of both hardwood and conifer trees. The generality of the model formulation is then evaluated by comparing the model's predictions against measurements from two other eddy-flux towers and forest inventories of the northeastern United States and Quebec. Despite the markedly different composition throughout this region, the optimized model realistically predicts observed patterns of carbon fluxes and tree growth. These results demonstrate how TBMs parameterized with field-based measurements can provide quantitative insight into the underlying biological processes governing ecosystem composition, structure, and function at larger scales.},

We test the improved JULES model at a site in the Amazonian rainforest by comparing against measurements of vertical profiles of radiation through the canopy, eddy covariance measurements of carbon and energy fluxes, and also measurements of carbon isotopic fractionation from top canopy leaves.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nOverall, the new light interception formulation improves modelled photosynthetic carbon uptake compared to the standard big leaf approach used in the original JULES formulation. Additional model improvement was not significant when incorporating more realistic vertical variation of photosynthetic capacity. Even with the improved representation of radiation interception, JULES simulations of net carbon uptake underestimate eddy covariance measurements by 14{\%}. This discrepancy can be removed by either increasing the photosynthetic capacity throughout the canopy or by explicitly including light inhibition of leaf respiration. Along with published evidence of such inhibition of leaf respiration, our study suggests this effect should be considered for inclusion in other GCMs.},

abstract = {Plant photosynthesis tends to increase with irradiance. However, recent theoretical and observational studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis is also more efficient under diffuse light conditions. Changes in cloud cover or atmospheric aerosol loadings, arising from either volcanic or anthropogenic emissions, alter both the total photosynthetically active radiation reaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation that is diffuse, with uncertain overall effects on global plant productivity and the land carbon sink. Here we estimate the impact of variations in diffuse fraction on the land carbon sink using a global model modified to account for the effects of variations in both direct and diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis. We estimate that variations in diffuse fraction, associated largely with the 'global dimming' period, enhanced the land carbon sink by approximately one-quarter between 1960 and 1999. However, under a climate mitigation scenario for the twenty-first century in which sulphate aerosols decline before atmospheric CO(2) is stabilized, this 'diffuse-radiation' fertilization effect declines rapidly to near zero by the end of the twenty-first century.},

One region of concern is southern British Columbia, specifically the Georgia Basin, where emissions are expected to increase owing to the expansion of industry and urban centres (Vancouver and Victoria). In the current study, weathering rates and critical loads of acidity (S and N) far forest soils were estimated at nineteen sites located within the Georgia Basin. A base cation to aluminium ratio of 10 was selected as the critical chemical criterion associated with ecosystem damage. The majority of the sites (58{\%}) had low base cation weathering rates (<= 50 meq m(-2) y(-1)) based on the PROFILE model. Accordingly. Mean critical load for the study sites, estimated using the stead-state mass balance model. ranged between 129 168 meq m(-2) y(-1), Annual average total (wet and dry) S and N deposition during the period 2005 2006 (estimated by the Community Multiscale Air Quality model), exceeded critical load at nine of the study sites (mean exceedance = 32 46 meq m(-2) y(-1)). The high-elevation (>1000 in) souk sites had shallow. acid sensitive, soils with low weathering rates; however, critical loads were predominantly exceeded at sites close to Vancouver under higher modelled deposition loads. The extol, of exceedance is similar to other industrial regions in western and eastern Canada.},

A mosaic-like leaf distribution increases K. 6. The development of the production structure of a plant community, especially of the photosynthetic system, is strongly constrained by matter production. For example, the lower layer can only develop according to the remaining productivity, which corresponds to the brightness under the leaf area of the upper layer.

The performance of the algorithm has been extensively tested in prototyping activities prior to operational production. Considerable attention was paid to characterizing the quality of the product and this information is available to the users as quality assessment (QA) accompanying the product. The MODIS LAI/FPAR product has been operationally produced from day one of science data processing from MODIS and is available free of charge to the users from the Earth Resources Observation System (EROS) Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center. Current and planned validation activities are aimed at evaluating the product at several field sites representative of the six structural biomes. Example results illustrating the physics and performance of the algorithm are presented together with initial QA and validation results. Potential users of the product are advised of the provisional nature of the product in view of changes to calibration, geolocation, cloud screening, atmospheric correction and ongoing validation activities. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The forest canopy is now considered a structurally complex and ecologically critical subsystem of the forest, and is defined as "the combination of all foliage, twigs, fine branches, their attending flora and fauna, the interstices (air), and their environment." For many critical canopy functions, all plants contribute. Similarly, the forest environment changes continuously from top to bottom, so the gradients cannot be subdivided objectively. In mixed-species, multi-aged stands, the upper layers alone do not represent canopy structure and all its microhabitats, microclimates, and exchange processes. Thus, researchers now recognize that the forest canopy is part of the forest ecosystem as a whole. Non-forest vegetation also supports canopies, such as kelp "forests," algal mats on a river bed, beds of sea grasses, orchards, lawns, wheat fields, and stromatolite aggregates. The chapter restricts the discussion to canopies associated with tall, woody plants; that is, terrestrial forests. In this context, the term canopy denotes forest community architecture as well as species composition, nutrient cycling, energy transfer, and plant-animal interactions from the ground to the forest-atmosphere interface. It also discusses the development of canopy studies and summarizes the general features of canopy composition, structure, and distribution. It identifies ways that humans and forest canopies have been linked through history and in the present, and then discusses the dependence of our species on forest canopies for fiber, fuel, food, medicines, and spirituality. It describes the involvement of forest canopies in pressing issues for anthropogenic change, such as biodiversity declines, carbon storage, and landscape management. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Consideration of clustering of branches into whorls is the latest addition to this model. Modification of the GORT model to include whorl orientation improves the ability to model the observed patterns of solar radiation transmission as a function of solar zenith angle and height in the canopy. Whorl orientation distributions are derived from multidirectional measurements using a geometric optical mutual shadowing model. For BOREAS test stands, model estimates and vertical measurements of photosynthetically active radiation transmittance within the canopy show (1) general decreases in transmission as solar zenith angles increase in the range of solar zenith angles dominated by beam irradiance, (2) increases in PAR transmission at very high solar zenith angles where diffuse skylight is dominant, (3) maximum scattering and absorption occur in the middle of the canopy. Model estimates match measurements from the forest floor, indicating the value of the model for providing radiation inputs to snowmelt models in forested landscapes.},

abstract = {A Geometric-Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) approach for modeling the radiation regime within plant canopies is capable of predicting temporal variation in the albedo of boreal conifer forests. Model predictions of daily surface albedo patterns and reflected solar radiation during the winter and summer seasons were validated using field measurements from two forest stands in the northern study area of BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) in 1995. The model is able to predict the "W" shape for the daily albedo over the sparse old jack pine forest stand during the snow season and the "bowl" shape of daily albedo during clear days in the summer. Results immediately following new snow and at the end of the snowmelt season indicate the sensitivity of overall forest albedos to the albedo of snow. Incorporation of time-varying values for snow albedo may improve future efforts to estimate forest albedos in the winter. Forest albedos are a complicated function of the canopy structure, the presence or absence of snow on the ground and the angular distribution of irradiance. These effects differ for the visible, near-infrared and midinfrared portions of the solar spectrum. Forest albedos vary dramatically as a function of canopy cover when snow covers the ground, but very little when snow is not present. It is found that for tree cover over about 70{\%}, the presence of snow has little effect on albedo.},

abstract = {This study develops a simple but physically based canopy radiative transfer scheme for photosynthesis, radiative fluxes and surface albedo estimates in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and particularly for the Ent Dynamic Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (Ent DGTEM). The Ent DGTEM can represent vegetation in mixed as opposed to homogeneous canopies. With active growth and competition, it must predict radiative transfer for dynamically changing vegetation structure, and requires computational speed for coupling with atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). The canopy radiative transfer scheme accounts for both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of plant canopies by combining the simple two-stream scheme with a well-described actual vertical foliage profile, an analytically derived foliage clumping factor from geometric optical theory, and, for needleleaf trees, an empirical needle-to-shoot-clumping factor. In addition, the model accounts for the effect of trunks, which is significant in bare canopies. This model provides better radiation estimates (light profiles, albedo) than the two-stream scheme currently being used in most GCMs to describe light interactions with vegetation canopies. This scheme has the same computational cost as the current typical scheme being used in GCMs, but promises to provide better canopy radiative transfer estimates for DGVMs, particularly those that model heterogeneous vegetation canopies. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Theories describing radiative transfer in plant canopies are very well developed for canopies approximating full cover. However, for canopies of partial cover such as orchards, wide-row crops or widely spaced individual plants, no general theory exists. This paper contains a description of a general radiative transfer model that is capable of accommodating nearly any canopy structure. The plant canopy is approximated by an array of ellipsoidal subcanopies that may be equally spaced, randomly spaced, or spaced in any manner desired. Ellipsoids were chosen because of the infinite variety of shapes that they can approximate. All of the foliage of any individual subcanopy is contained within the confines of its ellipsoidal subcanopy, and assumed to be statistically distributed within the subcanopy volume with respect to location, foliage angle, and foliage area per unit of subcanopy volume. The radiative transfer model includes attenuation of direct beam and sky diffuse radiation, multiple scattering for visible and near-infrared wavelength, and emission for thermal wavelengths. When the subcanopies overlap extensively, the predictions from the general ellipsoidal model approach the predictions from one-dimensional models applicable to canopies of full cover. Predictions from this three-dimensional model are compared with cross-row measurements in a corn canopy. In addition, sunfleck area and sunlit-leaf area comparisons are made between this three dimensional model and a one dimensional model for a developing corn canopy.},

abstract = {[ 1] We devise a computer efficient and flexible inversion technique to retrieve vegetation canopy parameters, in particular the Leaf Area Index, from the radiance field emerging at the top of a structurally heterogeneous systems overlying an anisotropic spatially uniform surface background. The proposed inversion strategy focuses on a reanalysis of multiangle and multispectral measurements unhindered by the many specific constraints imposed by the operational application of the current algorithms and their associated limitations on data staging. This technique capitalizes on the decoupling between contributions due to the canopy only and those invoking the background reflectance properties. These contributions are decomposed into the wavelength dependent and independent contributions. A quasi-linear relationship is thus obtained between the radiance/reflectance emerging from the top of the canopy layer and the background reflectance. Although all individual contributions can be estimated from accurate three-dimensional radiation transfer models, we propose appropriate approximations in order to estimate the minor terms. These approximations exploit the relatively limited dependency exhibited by these relatively smaller contributions with respect to the azimuthal coordinate. Moreover, additional mathematical developments are proposed to further approximate these terms by their corresponding solutions obtained in the limit case of a plane-parallel turbid medium scenario. They require defining effective values of the state variables entering the plane-parallel turbid medium model. The resulting reflectance of a three-dimensional spatially heterogeneous vegetation layer is driven by a sum of contributions that can be precomputed offline on the basis of the three-dimensional and plane-parallel homogeneous turbid medium model capabilities. The decoupling of the intrinsic vegetation and the background contributions allows many of the contributions to be precomputed and stored in look-up tables. This development yields a simple and computer efficient inversion scheme that allows us to jointly retrieve the values of the main vegetation layer attributes and the underlying background radiative properties. Demonstration tests based on actual multiangular and multispectral data set are currently being investigated.},

In this letter, we report on validating the global foliage clumping map derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 500 m resolution using new information about vertical profiles of foliage clumping in a wide range of forest type stands. We report that in moderate to dense forest stands with developed undergrowth layer, in situ measurements near the ground surface may considerably underestimate the overall canopy-level clumping effect. This is because the large gaps between tree crowns at upper levels of the canopy may not be all measured near the ground due to obscurity by lower vegetation of branches. This information about height variation of CI is shown to be important for correct estimating and validating the foliage clumping from airborne/satellite remote sensing.},

The global mapping of the clumping index with a limited eight-month multi-angular POLDER 1 dataset is expanded by integrating new, complete year-round observations from POLDER 3. We show that terrain-induced shadows can enhance bi-directional reflectance distribution function variation and negatively bias the clumping index (i.e. indicating more vegetation clumping) in rugged terrain. Using a global high-resolution digital elevation model, a topographic compensation function is devised to correct for this terrain effect. The clumping index reductions can reach up to 30{\%} from the topographically non-compensated values, depending on terrain complexity and land cover type.

abstract = {Clumping index is the measure of foliage grouping relative to a random distribution of leaves in space. It is a key structural parameter of plant canopies that influences canopy radiation regimes and controls canopy photosynthesis and other land-atmosphere interactions. The Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index has been previously used to retrieve global clumping index maps from POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) data at {\~{}}6. km resolution and the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 500. m resolution. Most recently the algorithm was also applied with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data at 275. m resolution over selected areas. In this study for the first time we characterized and compared the three products over a set of sites representing diverse biomes and different canopy structures. The products were also directly validated with both in-situ vertical profiles and available seasonal trajectories of clumping index over several sites. We demonstrated that the vertical distribution of foliage and especially the effect of understory need to be taken into account while validating foliage clumping products from remote sensing products with values measured in the field. Satellite measurements responded to the structural effects near the top of canopies, while ground measurements may be biased by the lower vegetation layers. Additionally, caution should be taken regarding the misclassification in land cover maps as their errors can propagate into the foliage clumping maps. Our results indicate that MODIS data and MISR data, with 275. m in particular, can provide good quality clumping index estimates at spatial scales pertinent for modeling local carbon and energy fluxes.},

abstract = {Methods for analyzing foliage nonrandomness by means of the TRAC instrument, digital hemispheric photography, and a gap fraction model are assessed at two RAMI (RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison) mature stands in J??rvselja, Estonia. The six different methods involve calculation of the canopy element clumping index, at scales coarser than that of a shoot. The major aim was to define the merits and limitations of the various methods. We conclude the gap size distribution and beyond-shoot clumping is very stable across the stands for the solar zenith angle range from 30?? to 60?? Estimates based on the gap size distribution and the combination of gap size and logarithm methods performed the best while compared with an independent gap fraction model. We clarify the effect of the assumed leaf inclination angle distribution on gap size distribution and differences between estimates of beyond-shoot clumping. We show that the modified, gap-size distribution based method of Chen and Cihlar can provide reliable beyond-shoot clumping estimates without any a priori assumptions about the total gap fraction, segment length or the leaf inclination angle distribution. We also illustrate the changes in element clumping with measurement height. The compiled data extend the original parameter dataset to be used in the next phase of RAMI for different benchmark tests and reflectance modeling experiments, and contribute toward systematic validation efforts of radiative transfer models, operational algorithms, and field instruments, as promoted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To explore the potential of multiangle remote sensing for estimating biophysical or ecological parameters over a variety of landscapes, a modeling tool that is capable of handling three-dimensional (3-D) heterogeneous structures, deriving ecological parameters from the vegetation structure, and effectively working on different scene scales is very desirable. A 3-D scene modeling approach for these purposes is presented in this paper. This 3-D model fulfills its goal by taking advantage of radiosity theory and computer graphics techniques. It consists of two major modules: a modified extended L-systems (MELS) method to generate a 3-D realistic scene and a radiosity-graphics combined method (RGM) to calculate the radiation regime based on the 3-D structures rendered with MELS. The 3-D simulation tool is then evaluated using field measurements of both plant structure and spectra collected during the NASA Earth Observing Satellite Prototype Validation Exercise Jornada field campaign near Las Cruces, NM. The modeled scene reflectance is compared with measurements from three platforms (ground, tower, and satellite) at various scales (from the size of individual shrub component to satellite pixels of kilometers). The agreement with measured reflectances is excellent at all sampling scales tested. As an example of the model's application, we use the model output to examine the validity of a linear mixture scheme over the Jornada semidesert scene. The result shows that the larger the sampling size (at least larger than the size of the shrub component), the better the hypothesis is satisfied because of the unique structure of the Jornada scene: dense plant clumps (shrub component) sparsely scattered on a predominantly bare soil background. A range of possible applications of this 3-D scene model is highlighted, and further work needed for 3-D modeling is also discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.},

The goal is to determine if other predictor variables, in addition to the clearness index, will significantly educe the standard error of Liu- and Jordan-type correlations (IdI = f(k1)). Stepwise regression is used to reduce a set of 28 potential predictor variables down to four significant predictors: the clearness index, solar altitude, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. A piecewise correlation over three ranges of clearness indices is developed to predict the diffuse fraction as a function of these four variables. A second piecewise correlation is developed for predicting the diffuse fraction as a function of the clearness index and solar altitude, for use when temperature and relative humidity are not available. A third piecewise correlation of the Liu- and Jordan-type is developed from the same data set. Comparing this correlation with the new correlations provides a direct measure of the value of added predictor variables. The full diffuse fraction correlation reduced the residual sum squares by 14{\%} when compared to the correlation that is a function of the clearness index only. The correlation including the clearness index and solar altitude diminished the residual sum squares by 9{\%}. The correlations exhibited some degree of location dependence. This is expected, as the climates are quite different. The correlations also showed some seasonal dependence; the errors are higher in the fall and winter than on an annual basis.},

Then we coupled atmospheric and canopy radiative transfer processes, with models that computed leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration on the sunlit and shaded portions of the vegetation and soil. At the annual time step, the mass and energy fluxes derived from BESS showed strong linear relations with measurements of solar irradiance (r2 = 0.95, relative bias: 8{\%}), gross primary productivity (r2 = 0.86, relative bias: 5{\%}) and evapotranspiration (r2 = 0.86, relative bias: 15{\%}) in data from 33 flux towers that cover seven plant functional types across arctic to tropical climatic zones. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration computed in BESS were most sensitive to leaf area index and solar irradiance, respectively. We quantified the mean global terrestrial estimates of gross primary productivity and evapotranpiration between 2001 and 2003 as 118  26 PgC yr1 and 500  104 mm yr1 (equivalent to 63,000  13,100 km3 yr1), respectively. BESS-derived gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration estimates were consistent with the estimates from independent machine-learning, data-driven products, but the process-oriented structure has the advantage of diagnosing sensitivity of mechanisms. The process-based BESS is able to offer gridded biophysical variables everywhere from local to the total global land scales with an 8-day interval over multiple years.},

abstract = {Effective leaf area index is routinely quantified with optical instruments that measure gap fraction through the probability of beam penetration of sunlight through the vegetation. However, there have been few efforts to obtain theoretically consistent effective leaf area indices from those measurements. To apply the Beer-Lambert law, multiple gap fraction measurements may be averaged in two ways: (1) by taking the mean of the logarithms of the individual gap fraction values or (2) by taking the logarithm of the mean gap fraction. Based on a theoretical model and gap fraction measurements from 41 sites, we report that effective leaf area index must be quantified using the second approach. The first approach implemented in the LAI-2000 instrument considers clumping effects at scales larger than shoots. Thus, the combination of the first approach with an independent clumping index overestimates leaf area index up to 30{\%} at the investigated sites. Clumping effects accounted for by the LAI-2000 instrument, called the "apparent" clumping index, were dependent on canopy cover, crown shape, and canopy height. A forest gap fraction model showed that short canopy height, vertically prolonged crown shape and higher canopy cover are associated with the lowest apparent clumping indices. We show that the apparent clumping index is a useful quantity to constrain the true clumping index and to investigate spatial and temporal variation of clumping effects. Such information would be useful to evaluate a coarse global clumping index map and improve land surface models. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Savannas are spatially heterogeneous, open ecosystems, thus efforts to quantify canopy structure with methods developed for homogeneous, closed canopies are prone to failure. We examine the applicability of two direct (litterfall, allometry) and five indirect (LAI-2000, TRAC, digital hemispheric photography, digital cover photography, traversing radiometer system) methods to determine leaf area index across a 9 ha domain in an oak-savanna ecosystem in California, USA. Interpretation of the leaf area index measurements is supported by two gap-fraction models. We recommend that leaf inclination angle distribution should be characterized first. For this purpose, we propose a simple, reliable and reproducible method using a digital camera. We show that the combination of digital cover photography and LAI-2000 could provide spatially representative leaf area index, gap fraction and element clumping index. Based on these two indirect methods, we quantify spatially representative element clumping index and leaf area index at ecosystem scale as 0.49 ?? 0.10 (mean ?? 95{\%} confidence interval) and 0.77 ?? 0.27, respectively. In contrast to previous studies in northern ecosystems, measurement and modeling results suggest that element clumping index decreases with view zenith angle, most likely due to apparent changes of tree distribution pattern with the view zenith angle. Our results highlight the importance of ecosystem-scale clumping effects for the adequate quantification of tree leaf area index in savannas. Finally, we suggest a protocol to quantify leaf area index and its associated canopy structure variables in open canopy ecosystems. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of leaf area index (LAI) at ecosystem scale is critical for evaluating and modeling the response of vegetation to environmental variability and change. We present an approach for quantifying daily ecosystem LAI that integrates automatic acquisition of a small number of reference photos, viewed towards the zenith, and a larger number of photos covering a spatially extensive area that were manually acquired during periodic field trips. We present an image archive spanning three years for an oak-savanna ecosystem in California to identify the timing of phenological and disturbance events, and to quantify the seasonal to interannual variability of tree LAI at ecosystem scale. The digital camera-derived LAI, corrected for clumping effects, agreed well (r 2=0.94, root mean square error=0.05) with independent estimates of LAI from litterfall traps and the LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product, which combined grass and tree LAI, we obtained realistic seasonal patterns of ecosystem LAI that corresponded with tree LAI from the digital cameras for the period when grass was dead. The digital camera method is an easy and inexpensive way to monitor LAI at ecosystem scale. This method can be used for testing and improving phenology models, evaluating remote-sensing-derived LAI products, and quantifying forest structures in rapidly changing environments. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model and multidate, multispectral data to provide global 1-km gridded and tiled products of the land surface every 16 days. These products include directional hemispherical albedo (black-sky albedo), bihemispherical albedo (white-sky albedo), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted surface Reflectances (NBAR), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The algorithm has been consistently producing albedo and NBAR for the public since July 2000. Initial evaluations indicate a stable BRDF/Albedo Product, where, for example, the spatial and temporal progression of phenological characteristics is easily detected in the NBAR and albedo results.

abstract = {Predictions of the effects of climate change on the extent of forests, savannas and deserts are usually based on simple response models derived from actual vegetation distributions. In this review, we show two major problems with the implicitly assumed straightforward cause-effect relationship. Firstly, several studies suggest that vegetation itself may have considerable effects on regional climate implying a positive feedback, which can potentially lead to large-scale hysteresis. Secondly, vegetation ecologists have found that effects of plants on microclimate and soils can cause a microscale positive feedback, implying that critical precipitation conditions for colonization of a site may differ from those for disappearance from that site. We argue that it is important to integrate these nonlinearities at disparate scales in models to produce more realistic predictions of potential effects of climate change and deforestation.},

The increased need to understand local to global dynamics of ecosystems, a prerequisite to understand the coupling of the biosphere to other components of Earth systems, has created a demand for extensive ecosystem structure data. Repeated satellite observations of vegetation patterns in two dimensions have made significant contributions to our understanding of the state and dynamics of the global biosphere. Recent advances in remote sensing technology allow us to view the biosphere in three dimensions and provide us with refined measurements of horizontal, as well as vertical, structure of forests. This paper provides an introductory review of the importance of the three‐dimensional characterization of terrestrial ecosystem structure of forests and woodlands and its potential measurement from space. We discuss the relevance of these measurements for reducing the uncertainties of terrestrial carbon cycle and the response of ecosystems to future climate. By relating the 3‐D structure to forest biomass, carbon content, disturbance characteristics, and habitat diversity, we examine the requirements for future satellite sensors in terms of precision and spatial and temporal resolutions. In particular, we focus this review on measurements from lidar and radar sensors that provide vertical and horizontal characterization of vegetation and are currently recommended for next generation of NASA’s Earth observing and European Earth Explorer systems.},

However, the assumption of Beer’s Law is not appro- priate for leaf canopies and this empirical approach needs to be used with caution. Alternatively, classic derivations of radiation intercep- tion by leaf canopies have resulted in a similar exponential form de- fined as a function of time of day, day of year, and latitude.Acommon experimental approach of determining the extinction coefficient from midday measurements results in a minimum coefficient that under- predicts the total daily radiation interception. Two approaches are ex- plored to improve the estimates of daily radiation interception under a clear sky. The first approach compared extinction coefficients calcu- lated for midday against ones calculated as representative of radiation interception over the entire day. A linear correlation was found be- tween the two extinction coefficients so that the midday extinction coefficient could be corrected to obtain a coefficient representative of the entire day under a clear sky. The second approach estimated the time of day when measurements could be made to obtain directly an extinction coefficient representative of the entire day. While such times in the day could be identified, this approach is impractical be- cause the periods for taking these measurements are short and dependent on leaf angle.},

abstract = {Simulations of the different components of the spectral radiation budget of structurally simple leaf and shoot canopies with varying canopy leaf area index (LAI) were performed. The aims were (1) to test a proposed parameterization of the budget using two spectrally invariant canopy structural parameters (p and pt) governing canopy absorption and transmittance, respectively, and (2) to incorporate the effect of within-shoot scattering in the parameterization for shoot canopies. Results showed that canopy spectral absorption and scattering were well described by a single parameter, the canopy p value or 'recollision probability', which was closely related to LAI. The relationship between p and LAI was however different in leaf and shoot canopy: e.g., at the same LAI the recollision probability was larger in the shoot canopy. It was shown that the p value of the shoot canopy could be decomposed into the p value of an individual shoot (psh) and the p value of the leaf canopy with the same effective LAI (LAIe). The canopy p value allows calculation of canopy absorption and scattering at any given wavelength from the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient at the same wavelength. To calculate canopy reflectance, separation of the downward and upward scattered parts is needed in addition. The proposed parameter pt worked rather well in the leaf canopy at moderate values of LAI, but not in the coniferous shoot canopy nor at high values of LAI. However, the simulated fraction of upward scattered radiation increased in a straightforward manner with LAI, and was not particularly sensitive to the leaf (or needle) scattering coefficient. Judged by this 'smooth' behavior, the existence of another kind of simple parameterization for this separation remains an interesting possibility. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of canopy structure specification on modeling net radiation (R-n), latent heat flux (LE) and net photosynthesis (A(n)) by coupling two contrasting radiation transfer models with a two-leaf photosynthesis model for a maturing loblolly pine stand near Durham, North Carolina, USA. The first radiation transfer model is based on a uniform canopy representation (UCR) that assumes leaves are randomly distributed within the canopy, and the second radiation transfer model is based on a gappy canopy representation (GCR) in which leaves are clumped into individual crowns, thereby forming gaps between the crowns. To isolate the effects of canopy structure on model results, we used identical model parameters taken from the literature for both models. Canopy structure has great impact on energy distribution between the canopy and the forest floor. Comparing the model results, UCR produced lower R-n, higher LE and higher A(n) than GCR. UCR intercepted more shortwave radiation inside the canopy, thus producing less radiation absorption on the forest floor and in turn lower R-n. There is a higher degree of nonlinearity between A(n) estimated by UCR and by GCR than for LE. Most of the difference for LE and A(n) between UCR and GCR occurred around noon, when gaps between crowns can be seen from the direction of the incident sunbeam. Comparing with eddy-covariance measurements in the same loblolly pine stand from May to September 2001, based on several measures GCR provided more accurate estimates for R-n, LE and A(n) than UCR. The improvements when using GCR were much clearer when comparing the daytime trend of LE and A(n) for the growing season. Sensitivity analysis showed that UCR produces higher LE and A(n) estimates than GCR for canopy cover ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. There is a high degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between UCR estimates for A(n) and those of GCR, particularly when canopy cover is low, and suggests that simple scaling of UCR parameters cannot compensate for differences between the two models. LE from UCR and GCR is also nonlinearly related when canopy cover is low, but the nonlinearity quickly disappears as canopy cover increases, such that LE from UCR and GCR are linearly related and the relationship becomes stronger as canopy cover increases. These results suggest the uniform canopy assumption can lead to underestimation of R-n, and overestimation of LE and A(n). Given the potential in mapping regional scale forest canopy structure with high spatial resolution optical and Lidar remote sensing plotforms, it is possible to use GCR for up-scaling ecosystem processes from flux tower measurements to heterogeneous landscapes, provided the heterogeneity is not too extreme to modify the flow dynamics.},

abstract = {We analyzed 7 years (2002{\&}{\#}8211;2008) of micrometeorological and concurrent biological observations of carbon and water fluxes at a mature ponderosa pine forest in central Oregon in a semiarid climate. We sought to evaluate the extent that gross primary productivity, net ecosystem exchange, ecosystem respiration, net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, tree transpiration, and evapotranspiration varied seasonally and interannually in this ecosystem subjected to varying periods and severity of droughts. To explain variation, we found it necessary to define seasons functionally within a hydroecological year rather than by fixed calendar dates. The interannual variability in growing season length was large (45 days), and the end date was more variable than the onset. Plant-available soil water was the main determinant of carbon fluxes. Spring evapotranspiration primarily used shallow water, whereas summer and fall evapotranspiration drew water from deeper in the soil profile. A multiyear drought (2001{\&}{\#}8211;2003) had a more severe and fundamentally different impact on carbon and water cycles than a single-year (2005) drought because of carryover effects in soil water and carbohydrate reserves in plant tissue. Calendar year{\&}{\#}8211;based analysis was inadequate to diagnose drought years in precipitation and ecosystem drought response. Extension of meteorological records back to 1982 showed that anomalies were coherent across the region and that the observations represented below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures coherent with a warm-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The carbon sink of this seasonally water-limited ecosystem is anticipated to increase with increasing available soil water during the growing season.},

abstract = {When crops are grown in mixture systems, microclimate is modified, particularly the light regime. Experiments were conducted in Guadeloupe to examine the variability of the light field and test a light interception model in a traditional forage mixture made of angleton grass savanna planted with rows of gliricidia shrubs. Simulated figures of reflected, transmitted and absorbed PAR were in close agreement with experimental data measurements during the four periods of the study. The model was also used to simulate the influence of row orientation (N-S or E-W), location (North Tropic or Equator), and dates (winter solstice, equinox or summer solstice) on the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The presence of the shrubs strongly decreased the absorbance of the grass, which absorbed between 42{\%} and 50{\%} and 14{\%} and 19{\%}, respectively, in pure and mixed stands. Light capture by gliricidia ranged between 51{\%} and 66{\%}, and was not affected by the presence of the grass. In all cases the interception of the PAR was better for the mixed crop (+15{\%} and +30{\%} more than the pure shrubs and the pure grass, respectively). The influence of the non-photosynthetic organs of the shrubs was limited (about 2{\%}). A simple version of the model is presented, based on a modification of the extinction coefficient instead of the complete calculation of scattering. Differences between the two models are small. Results suggest that the effect of row orientation and season in this kind of perennial forage mixtures is limited. © 1995.},

Annual net uptake of CO2 ranged from 1.0 to 4.7 Mg-C ha?1yr?1, with an average of 2.5 Mg-C ha?1yr?1. Uptake rates increased systematically, nearly doubling over the period despite forest age of 75–110 years; there were parallel increases in midsummer photosynthetic capacity at high light level (21.5?31.5 mmole m?2s?1), woody biomass (101?115 Mg-C ha?1 from 1993?2005, mostly due to growth of one species, red oak), and peak leaf area index (4.5?5.5 from 1998–2005). The long-term trends were interrupted in 1998 by sharp declines in photosynthetic capacity, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) ofCO2, and other parameters, with recovery over the next 3 years. The observations were compared to empirical functions giving the mean responses to temperature and light, and to a terrestrial ecosystem model (IBIS2). Variations in gross ecosystem exchange of CO2 (GEE) and NEE on hourly to monthly timescales were represented well as prompt responses to the environment, but interannual variations and long-term trends were not. IBIS2 simulated mean annual NEE, but greatly overpredicted the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and did not predict the decadal trend. The drivers of interannual and decadal changes in NEE are long-term increases in tree biomass, successional change in forest composition, and disturbance events,},

abstract = {Leaf angle distribution is a key parameter to characterize canopy structure and plays a crucial role in controlling energy and mass balance in soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer system. Several leaf angle distribution functions found in literature have been proposed to account for the non-random distribution of leaf inclination angle with one or two parameters. In this paper, these leaf angle distribution functions (Beta distribution function, ellipsoidal function, rotated-ellipsoidal function, Verhoef's algorithm and de Wit's functions) were compared with field data collected in the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) project and two sites within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. All functions performed reasonably well. However, the comparison showed that the two-parameter functions including the Beta distribution function and Verhoef's algorithm commonly were more consistent predictors than one-parameter functions. G-statistics and $\chi$2 test applying to the estimates of leaf angle distribution demonstrated that Beta function presented more robustness over other functions, even the ellipsoidal leaf distribution function which has been widely used. Furthermore, the predictions of leaf angle distribution by these functions were used to calculate extinction coefficient and to separate foliage into sunlit and shaded parts. The results suggested that, ellipsoidal function may be suitable to be retrieved with remotely-sensed data and to compute extinction coefficient and fraction of sunlit foliage because this function requires only a single parameter, namely the ratio of the horizontal semi-axis length to the vertical semi-axis length of an ellipsoid. Finally, the comparison of three approaches (Nilson's, Fuchs' and Ross-Goudriaan's algorithms) for computing extinction coefficient indicated that, there was no significant difference between the three approaches. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The annual total of net leaf photosynthesis was 110{\%} more in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2. However, the trees in elevated CO2 grew only 59{\%} more biomass than the trees in ambient CO2 over the year. Modelling studies showed that larger loss of carbon from fine-root production and growth of the root-associated mycorrhiza by the trees in elevated CO2 probably accounted for all the remaining difference in net photosynthesis between the two treatments. Our modelling also showed that the fraction of net photosynthate consumed by respiration of nonleaf tissue was similar in the two CO2 treatments, and was 26{\%} and 24{\%} for trees in ambient and elevated CO2, respectively. Trees in elevated CO2 had 43{\%} more leaves, and produced 110{\%} more net photosynthate than trees in ambient CO2, even though the maximum rate of carboxylation per unit leaf nitrogen decreased by 21{\%}. Sensitivity studies showed that down-regulation reduced the annual net photosynthetic production of the trees in elevated CO2 by only 6{\%}. Direct effects of higher CO2 on photosynthesis and greater leaf area of the trees in elevated CO2 increased the net photosynthesis of the trees by 68{\%} and 60{\%}, respectively; and together accounted for most of the difference in net photosynthesis between the two treatments.},

If direct beam and diffuse radiation are considered separately with the appropriate extinction coefficients, Beer's law can be used to estimate the fraction of absorbed visible radiation quite accurately, as compared with the other two models. However, Beer's law always overestimates the fraction of absorbed near-infrared radiation because of the significant loss of scattered radiation in the near-infrared radiation waveband; the error can be up to 50{\%}, compared with the two-stream approximation. The error is systematic and is not reduced by integrating over a day or longer. It can be even larger if absorption of direct beam and diffuse radiation are not considered separately. Compared with the two-stream approximation, Goudriaan's model underestimates the amount of absorbed visible and near-infrared radiation, and consequently net photosynthesis, and overestimates sensible heat fluxes of the canopy when Goudriaan's model is used to estimate the amount of radiation absorbed by sunlit and shaded leaves within a canopy in the CSIRO Biosphere Model. However, the mean differences in the calculated hourly fluxes of net canopy photosynthesis, latent and sensible heat are less than 5{\%} for a wheat crop during the whole growing season.},

abstract = {A small set of independent variables generally seems to suffice when attempting to describe the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to incident solar radiation. This set includes the soil reflectance, the single-scattering albedo, canopy transmittance, reflectance and interception, the portion of uncollided radiation in the total incident radiation, and portions of collided canopy transmittance and interception. All of these are measurable; they satisfy a simple system of equations and constitute a set that fully describes the law of energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any wavelength in the visible and near-infrared part of the solar spectrum. Further, the system of equations specifies the relationship between the optical properties at the leaf and the canopy scales. Thus, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if these variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to some of the physical properties of the canopy (e.g. leaf area index). This paper demonstrates this concept through retrievals of single-scattering albedo, canopy absorptance, portions of uncollided and collided canopy transmittance, and interception from hyperspectral data collected during a field campaign in Ruokolahti, Finland, June 14-21, 2000. The retrieved variables are then used to estimate canopy leaf area index, vegetation ground cover, and also the ratio of direct to total incident solar radiation at blue, green, red, and near-infrared spectral intervals. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {This paper investigates the application of a ground-based laser scanning system for providing quantitative tree measurements in densely stocked plantation forests. A methodology is tested in Kielder Forest, northern England using stands of mature Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and a structured mixture of Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), standing at tree densities of 600 and 2800 stems ha21 respectively. Three laser scans, two in the Sitka spruce and one in structured mixture, were collected using a Reigl Inc. LPM-300VHS high-speed laser scanner. Field measurements were recorded at the same time and included tree diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height. These measurements were then compared with those derived from the scanner. The results demonstrate that accurate measurements of tree diameter can be derived directly from the laser scan point cloud return in instances where the sensor’s view of the tree is not obstructed. Measurements of upper stem diameters, branch internodal distance and canopy dimensions can also be measured from the laser scan data. However, at the scanning spatial resolution selected, it was not possible to measure branch size. The level of detail that can be obtained from the scan data is dependent on the number and location of scans within the plot as well as the scanning resolution. Essentially, as the shadowing caused by tree density or branching frequency increases, the amount of useful information contained in the scan decreases},

Relationships for potential values of direct and diffuse, visible and near-infrared radiation were established from “clear day” experimental data. Estimates of total visible (PAR) and near-infrared radiation were made by partitioning the measurement of solar radiation using estimates of potential visible and potential near-infrared radiation. Estimates of direct components in the visible and near-infrared were made with relationships developed from the experimental data. There was good agreement between predicted and measured values of the various components of solar radiation.

RAMI4PILPS evaluates models under perfectly controlled experimental conditions in order to eliminate uncertainties arising from an incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the structural, spectral and illumination related canopy characteristics typical for model comparison with in situ observations. More specifically, the shortwave radiation is separated into a visible and near-infrared spectral region, and the quality of the simulated radiative fluxes is evaluated by direct comparison with a 3-D Monte Carlo reference model identified during the third phase of the Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise. The RAMI4PILPS setup thus allows to focus in particular on the numerical accuracy of shortwave radiative transfer formulations and to pinpoint to areas where future model improvements should concentrate. The impact of increasing degrees of structural and spectral subgrid variability on the simulated fluxes is documented and the relevance of any thus emerging biases with respect to gross primary production estimates and shortwave radiative forcings due to snow and fire events are investigated.},

abstract = {The radiation transfer model intercomparison (RAMI) activity aims at assessing the reliability of physics-based radiative transfer (RT) models under controlled experimental conditions. RAMI focuses on computer simulation models that mimic the interactions of radiation with plant canopies. These models are increasingly used in the development of satellite retrieval algorithms for terrestrial essential climate variables (ECVs). Rather than applying ad hoc performance metrics, RAMI-IV makes use of existing ISO standards to enhance the rigor of its protocols evaluating the quality of RT models. ISO-13528 was developed “to determine the performance of individual laboratories for specific tests or measurements.” More specifically, it aims to guarantee that measurement results fall within specified tolerance criteria from a known reference. Of particular interest to RAMI is that ISO-13528 provides guidelines for comparisons where the true value of the target quantity is unknown. In those cases, “truth” must be replaced by a reliable “conventional reference value” to enable absolute performance tests. This contribution will show, for the first time, how the ISO-13528 standard developed by the chemical and physical measurement communities can be applied to proficiency testing of computer simulation models. Step by step, the pre-screening of data, the identification of reference solutions, and the choice of proficiency statistics will be discussed and illustrated with simulation results from the RAMI-IV “abstract canopy” scenarios. Detailed performance statistics of the participating RT models will be provided and the role of the accuracy of the reference solutions as well as the choice of the tolerance criteria will be highlighted.},

abstract = {[1] The Radiation Transfer Model Intercomparison ( RAMI) initiative benchmarks canopy reflectance models under well-controlled experimental conditions. Launched for the first time in 1999, this triennial community exercise encourages the systematic evaluation of canopy reflectance models on a voluntary basis. The first phase of RAMI focused on documenting the spread among radiative transfer (RT) simulations over a small set of primarily 1-D canopies. The second phase expanded the scope to include structurally complex 3-D plant architectures with and without background topography. Here sometimes significant discrepancies were noted which effectively prevented the definition of a reliable ``surrogate truth,'' over heterogeneous vegetation canopies, against which other RT models could then be compared. The present paper documents the outcome of the third phase of RAMI, highlighting both the significant progress that has been made in terms of model agreement since RAMI-2 and the capability of/need for RT models to accurately reproduce local estimates of radiative quantities under conditions that are reminiscent of in situ measurements. Our assessment of the self-consistency and the relative and absolute performance of 3-D Monte Carlo models in RAMI-3 supports their usage in the generation of a ``surrogate truth'' for all RAMI test cases. This development then leads ( 1) to the presentation of the ``RAMI Online Model Checker'' (ROMC), an open-access web-based interface to evaluate RT models automatically, and ( 2) to a reassessment of the role, scope, and opportunities of the RAMI project in the future.},

abstract = {Volcanic eruptions can alter the quality of incoming solar irradiance reaching the Earth's surface thereby influencing the interactions between vegetation and the Earth system. Isoprene (C5H8) is a biogenic volatile organic compound emitted from leaves at a rate that is strongly dependent on the received flux of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). We used a theoretical approach to investigate the potential for volcanic eruptions to change the isoprene flux from terrestrial forests using canopy-scale isoprene emission simulations that vary either the relative or absolute amount of diffuse (I-diff) and direct (I-dir) PAR. According to our simulations for a northern hardwood deciduous forest, if the total amount of PAR during summer remains constant while the proportion of I-diff increases, canopy-scale isoprene emissions increase. This effect increases as leaf area index (LAI) increases. Simulating a decrease in the total amount of PAR, and a corresponding increase in I-diff fraction, as measured during the 1992 Pinatubo eruption, changes daily total canopy-scale isoprene emissions from terrestrial vegetation in summertime by +2.8{\%} and -1.4{\%} for LAI of 6 and 2, respectively. These effects have not previously been realized or quantified. Better capturing the effects of volcanic eruptions (and other major perturbations to the atmospheric aerosol content) on isoprene emissions from the terrestrial biosphere, and hence on the chemistry of the atmosphere, therefore may require inclusion of the effects of aerosols they produce on climate and the quality of PAR.},

abstract = {[1] Radiation and turbulent energy exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere is an important component of land surface-atmosphere interaction. Vegetation properties strongly influence this exchange. Commonly, two-stream models are used to compute net absorbed radiation and the partitioning of absorbed radiation between the vegetation canopy and substrate. Also, the roughness lengths for momentum and heat are often parameterized as simple functions of vegetation height. In this paper, we examine the influence of vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure on land surface radiation and energy balance over nonuniform forest canopies. To do this, parameterizations that account for the effects of canopy 3-D structure on radiation and turbulent energy exchange were implemented in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) land surface model (LSM) version 1.0. The NCAR LSM then was run offline for a time period encompassing both wet and dry soil moisture conditions using forcing data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Radiation and energy balance within the vegetation canopy and at the soil surface were examined at diurnal timescales. Results show that the 3-D parameterizations increased net radiation absorbed by the soil surface and that this additional available energy was primarily dissipated through ground evaporation when soil moisture was not limiting. When the soil was dry, the available energy at the soil surface was mostly converted to sensible heat with relatively little change in the ground heat flux. In addition, modeled sensible heat from the vegetation canopy decreased, and relatively small changes in modeled canopy transpiration were observed. Comparisons of modeled heat fluxes using the 3-D parameterizations against observations show improvement over the original treatment included in the NCAR LSM, suggesting that careful treatment of vegetation properties is important to accurate modeling of flux quantities above and underneath the canopy in soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) models.},

abstract = {Net solar radiation (Q*) and the partitioning of Q* between vegetation (Q(veg)*) and the substrate (Q(soil)*) are important quantities computed by soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) models. Commonly, two-stream models of canopy radiative transfer are used for this purpose. We examine the validity of this approach for nonuniform canopies and compare estimates of Q*, Q(veg)*, and Q(soil)* computed using a two-stream model with estimates computed using a model that accounts for the effects of three-dimensional (3-D) structure in vegetation on radiative transfer, To accomplish these goals, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for the key input parameters to two-stream canopy radiative transfer models. The parameters examined include leaf area index (L), leaf optical properties, solar zenith angle, leaf orientation, and background albedo. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted using a Geometric-Optical Radiative Transfer (GORT) model. The GORT model treats vegetation canopies as being composed of 3-D crowns and allows for both vertical variation in leaf area and horizontal variation in stem density, Results show that Q* computed by the two-stream model varies by up to 10{\%} relative to the GORT model. Further, the partitioning of Q* between the vegetation canopy and substrate computed by the two-stream model can vary by up to 30{\%} relative to the more realistic GORT model, even for relatively dense canopies (L=6). These differences arise because two-stream models use parameterizations for gap probabilities that are not realistic in discontinuous canopies. Based on this conclusion, a parameterization is proposed to include the effects of canopy heterogeneity in two-stream models, Results from the original two-stream model, a parameterized two-stream model, and the GORT model are compared using data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. These results show that the proposed parameterization captures the effect of 3-D structure in vegetation on radiation regimes and is therefore suitable for inclusion in SVAT models. Inclusion of improved treatment for radiative fluxes in land surface parameterizations should improve modeled estimates for other flux quantities computed by SVAT models.},

abstract = {In a previous paper, we developed an analytical clumped two-stream model (ACTS) of canopy radiative transfer from an analytical geometric-optical and radiative transfer (GORT) scheme (Ni-Meister et al., 2010). The ACTS model accounts for clumping of foliage and the influence of trunks in vegetation canopies for modeling of photosynthesis, radiative fluxes and surface albedo in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and particularly for the Ent Dynamic Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DGTEM). This study evaluates the gap probability and transmittance estimates from the ACTS model by comparing the modeled results with ground-based data, as well as with the original full GORT model and a layered Beer's law scheme. The ground data used in this study include vertical profile measurements of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in (1) mixed deciduous forests in Morgan-Monroe State Forest, IN, USA, (2) coniferous forests in central Canada, (3) mixed deciduous forests in Harvard Forest, MA, and (4) ground lidar measurements of the canopy gap fraction in woodland in Australia. The model comparisons with these measurements demonstrate that the ACTS model achieves better or similar performance compared to the full GORT and the layered Beer's law schemes with regard to agreements with field measurements and computational cost. The ACTS model has excellent accuracy and flexibility to model the canopy gap probability and transmittance for various forest scenarios. Also, it has advantages relative to the currently widely used two-stream scheme through better radiation estimation for photosynthesis by accounting for the impact of both vertical and horizontal structure heterogeneity of complex vegetation on radiative transfer. Currently the ACTS is being implemented in Ent and will be further tested for how it improves surface energy balance and carbon flux estimates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Global products of vegetation green Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) are being operationally produced from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) at 1-km resolution and eight-day frequency. This paper summarizes the experience of several collaborating investigators on validation of MODIS LAI products and demonstrates the close connection between product validation and algorithm refinement activities. The validation of moderate resolution LAI products includes three steps: 1) field sampling representative of LAI spatial distribution and dynamic range within each major land cover type at the validation site; 2) development of a transfer function between field LAI measurements and high resolution satellite data to generate a reference LAI map over an extended area; and 3) comparison of MODIS LAI with aggregated reference LAI map at patch (multipixel) scale in view of geo-location and pixel shift uncertainties. The MODIS LAI validation experiences, summarized here, suggest three key factors that influence the accuracy of LAI retrievals: 1) uncertainties in input land cover data, 2) uncertainties in input surface reflectances, and 3) uncertainties from the model used to build the look-up tables accompanying the algorithm. This strategy of validation efforts guiding algorithm refinements has led to progressively more accurate LAI products from the MODIS sensors aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua platforms},

Comparing forest structural parameters retrieved using EVI data with extensive ground measurements, we found excellent agreement at the site level using five EVI scans (plots) per site (R2=0.94-0.99); very good agreement at the plot level for stem count density and biomass (R2=0.90-0.85); and good agreement at the plot level for mean DBH and basal area (R2=0.48-0.66). The observed variance at site and plot levels suggest that a sample area of at least 1ha (104m2) is required to estimate these parameters accurately at the stand level using either lidar-based or conventional methods. The algorithms and procedures used to retrieve these structural parameters are dependent on the unique ability of the Echidna® lidar to digitize the full waveform of the scattered lidar pulse as it returns to the instrument, which allows consistent separation of scattering by trunks and large branches from scattering by leaves. This successful application of ground-based lidar technology opens the door to rapid and accurate measurement of biomass and timber volume in areal sampling scenarios and as a calibration and validation tool for mapping biomass using airborne or spaceborne remotely sensed data. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In this research, a new method integrating the range dimension is presented for retrieving element clumping index using a unique series of images of gap probability (Pgap) with range from EVI. From these images, we identified connected gap components and found the approximate physical, rather than angular, size of connected gap component. We conducted trials at 30 plots within six conifer stands of varying height and stocking densities in the Sierra National Forest, CA, in August 2008. The element clumping index measurements retrieved from EVI Pgap image series for the hinge angle region are highly consistent (R 2=0.866) with those of hemispherical photos. Furthermore, the information contained in connected gap component size profiles does account for the difference between our method and gap-size distribution theory based method, suggesting a new perspective to measure element clumping index with EVI Pgap image series and also a potential advantage of three dimensional Lidar data for element clumping index retrieval. Therefore further exploration is required for better characterization of clumped condition from EVI Pgap image series. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, LAI is difficult to directly acquire for large spatial extents due to its time consuming and work intensive nature. Such efforts have been significantly improved by the emergence of optical and active remote sensing techniques. This paper reviews the definitions and theories of LAI measurement with respect to direct and indirect methods. Then, the methodologies for LAI retrieval with regard to the characteristics of a range of remotely sensed datasets are discussed. Remote sensing indirect methods are subdivided into two categories of passive and active remote sensing, which are further categorized as terrestrial, aerial and satellite-born platforms. Due to a wide variety in spatial resolution of remotely sensed data and the requirements of ecological modeling, the scaling issue of LAI is discussed and special consideration is given to extrapolation of measurement to landscape and regional levels.},

abstract = {This study develops an algorithm for representing detailed spectral features of vegetation albedo based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) observations at 7 discrete channels, referred to as the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Albedo (MEVA) algorithm. The MEVA algorithm empirically fills spectral gaps around the vegetation red edge near 0.7 $\mu$m and vegetation water absorption features at 1.48 and 1.92 $\mu$m which cannot be adequately captured by the MODIS 7 channels. We then assess the effects of applying MEVA in comparison to four other traditional approaches to calculate solar fluxes and aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) at the top of atmosphere (TOA) based on the MODIS discrete reflectance bands. By comparing the DRF results obtained through the MEVA method with the results obtained through the other four traditional approaches, we show that filling the spectral gap of the MODIS measurements around 0.7 $\mu$m based on the general spectral behavior of healthy green vegetation leads to significant improvement in the instantaneous aerosol DRF at TOA (up to 3.02 W m−2 difference or 48{\%} fraction of the aerosol DRF, −6.28 W m−2, calculated for high spectral resolution surface reflectance from 0.3 to 2.5 $\mu$m for deciduous vegetation surface). The corrections of the spectral gaps in the vegetation spectrum in the near infrared, again missed by the MODIS reflectances, also contributes to improving TOA DRF calculations but to a much lower extent (less than 0.27 W m−2, or about 4{\%} of the instantaneous DRF). Compared to traditional approaches, MEVA also improves the accuracy of the outgoing solar flux between 0.3 to 2.5 $\mu$m at TOA by over 60 W m−2 (for aspen 3 surface) and aerosol DRF by over 10 W m−2 (for dry grass). Specifically, for Amazon vegetation types, MEVA can improve the accuracy of daily averaged aerosol radiative forcing in the spectral range of 0.3 to 2.5 $\mu$m at equator at the equinox by 3.7 W m−2. These improvements indicate that MEVA can contribute to regional climate studies over vegetated areas and can help to improve remote sensing-based studies of climate processes and climate change.},

abstract = {An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate canopy reflectance data into an ecosystem model. We demonstrate the use of an augmented state vector approach to enable a canopy reflectance model to be used as a non-linear observation operator. A key feature of data assimilation (DA) schemes, such as the EnKF, is that they incorporate information on uncertainty in both the model and the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state of a system. In addition, estimates of uncertainty in the model outputs (given the observed data) are calculated, which is crucial in assessing the utility of model predictions. Results are compared against eddy-covariance observations of CO2 fluxes collected over three years at a pine forest site. The assimilation of 500??m spatial resolution MODIS reflectance data significantly improves estimates of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) from the model, with clear reduction in the resulting uncertainty of estimated fluxes. However, foliar biomass tends to be over-estimated compared with measurements. Issues regarding this over-estimate, as well as the various assumptions underlying the assimilation of reflectance data are discussed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This new model is known as the community land model (CLM2). In CLM2, the surface is represented by five primary subgrid land cover types (glacier, lake, wetland, urban, vegetated) in each grid cell. The vegetated portion of a grid cell is further divided into patches of up to 4 of 16 plant functional types, each with its own leaf and stem area index and canopy height. The relative area of each subgrid unit, the plant functional type, and leaf area index are obtained from 1-km satellite data. The soil texture dataset allows vertical profiles of sand and clay. Most of the physical parameterizations in the model were also updated. Major model differences include: 10 layers for soil temperature and soil water with explicit...},

abstract = {Terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycle processes remove {\~{}}55 {\%} of global carbon emissions, with the remaining 45 known as the airborne fraction, accumulating in the atmosphere. The long-term dynamics of the component fluxes contributing to the airborne fraction are challenging to interpret, but important for informing fossil-fuel emission targets and for monitoring the trends of biospheric carbon fluxes. Climate and land-cover forcing data for terrestrial ecosystem models are a largely unexplored source of uncertainty in terms of their contribution to understanding airborne fraction dynamics. Here we present results using a single dynamic global vegetation model forced by an ensemble experiment of climate (CRU, ERA-Interim, NCEP-DOE II), and diagnostic land-cover datasets (GLC2000, GlobCover, MODIS). For the averaging period 19962005, forcing uncertainties resulted in a large range of simulated global carbon fluxes, up to 13 {\%} for net primary production (52.4 to 60.2 Pg C a1) and 19 {\%} for soil respiration (44.2 to 54.8 Pg C a1). The sensitivity of contemporary global terrestrial carbon fluxes to climate strongly depends on forcing data (1.25.9 Pg C K1 or 0.5 to 2.7 ppmv CO2 K1), but weakening carbon sinks in sub-tropical regions and strengthening carbon sinks in northern latitudes are found to be robust. The climate and land-cover combination that best correlate to the inferred carbon sink, and with the lowest residuals, is from observational data (CRU) rather than reanalysis climate data and with land-cover categories that have more stringent criteria for forest cover (MODIS). Since 1998, an increasing positive trend in residual error from bottom-up accounting of global sinks and sources (from 0.03 (19892005) to 0.23 Pg C a1 (19982005)) suggests that either modeled drought sensitivity of carbon fluxes is too high, or that carbon emissions from net land-cover change is too large.},

abstract = {Simulations of the global water and carbon cycle are sensitive to the model representation of vegetation phenology. Current phenology models are empirical, and few predict both phenological timing and leaf state. Our previous study demonstrated how satellite data assimilation employing an Ensemble Kalman Filter yields realistic phenological model parameters for several ecosystem types. In this study the data assimilation framework is extended to global scales using a subgrid-scale representation of plant functional types (PFTs) and elevation classes. A reanalysis of vegetation phenology for 256 globally distributed regions is performed using 10 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation and leaf area index (LAI) data. The 9 . 10(8) quality screened observations (corresponding to {\textless}1{\%} of the globally available MODIS data) successfully constrain a posterior PFT-dependent phenological parameter set. It reduces the global FPAR and LAI prediction error to 20.6{\%} and 14.8{\%}, respectively, compared to the prior prediction error. A 50 year long (1960-2009) daily 1 degrees x 1 degrees global phenology data set with a mean FPAR and LAI prediction error of 0.065 (-) and 0.34 (m(2) m(-2)) is generated. Temperate phenology is best explained by a combination of light and temperature. Tropical evergreen phenology is found to be largely insensitive to moisture and light variations. Boreal phenology can be accurately predicted from local to global scales, while temperate and mediterranean landscapes might benefit from a better subgrid-scale PFT classification or from a more complex canopy radiative transfer model.},

The goal of this paper is the exploration of foliage distribution and light extinction in crowns of five canopy tree species in relation to their shoot architecture, leaf traits (mean leaf angle, life span, photosynthetic characteristics) and successional status (from pioneers to persistent). * Methods Light extinction was examined at three hierarchical levels of foliage organization, the whole crown, the outermost canopy and the individual shoots, in a tropical moist forest with direct canopy access with a tower crane. Photon flux density and cumulative leaf area index (LAI) were measured at intervals of 0{\{}middle dot{\}}25-1 m along multiple vertical transects through three to five mature tree crowns of each species to estimate light extinction coefficients (K). * Results Cecropia longipes, a pioneer species with the shortest leaf life span, had crown LAI {\textless}0{\{}middle dot{\}}5. Among the remaining four species, crown LAI ranged from 2 to 8, and species with orthotropic terminal shoots exhibited lower light extinction coefficients (0{\{}middle dot{\}}35) than those with plagiotropic shoots (0{\{}middle dot{\}}53-0{\{}middle dot{\}}80). Within each type, later successional species exhibited greater maximum LAI and total light extinction. A dense layer of leaves at the outermost crown of a late successional species resulted in an average light extinction of 61 {\%} within 0{\{}middle dot{\}}5 m from the surface. In late successional species, leaf position within individual shoots does not predict the light availability at the individual leaf surface, which may explain their slow decline of photosynthetic capacity with leaf age and weak differentiation of sun and shade leaves. * Conclusion Later-successional tree crowns, especially those with orthotropic branches, exhibit lower light extinction coefficients, but greater total LAI and total light extinction, which contribute to their efficient use of light and competitive dominance.},
